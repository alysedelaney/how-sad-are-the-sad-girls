One.\nShit.\nAh! Ouch.\nCome on.\nGuard your chin.\nEngage your core.\nThat's it.\nSteroids, right? You juicing? [GRUNTS.]\nKale.\nOne one, two, three.\n[GRUNTS.]\n[PANTING.]\n[SCREAMING.]\nYes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [YELLS EXCITEDLY.]\nYes! [CHUCKLES.]\n[TRISH.]\nNow what? That's what I'd ask you, but you're still putting the pieces back together.\nSo I'll use everything I've gleaned from you over the years.\nYou'd never admit it, but maybe you picked up a little something from me, too.\nThank you.\nThese stools aren't built for adult butts.\nBut the coffee's good and you wanted to talk.\nOver lunch, at an actual restaurant.\nI swear, we spent more time together when you were in a coma.\n- My schedule's a little hectic.\n- [DOROTHY SCOFFS.]\nImpressive, considering you don't have a job.\nMother, things are different now.\nI need a little time to myself.\nAnd I suppose I understand.\nAfter all you went through.\nThat awful doctor Jessica's mother.\nIt's worse for Jessica.\nWell, shooting that monster is the one heroic thing Jessica has ever done.\nSo they say.\nYou know, she's advertising now.\nTrying to be a hero.\nAs long as she leaves you out of it.\nOh, I'm out of it all right.\nYou don't need her, but you need someone in your corner.\nYou've isolated yourself.\nWell, it seems to come with the territory.\nWhat territory? It just Is this what you wanted to talk about? You need someone you can trust to help you turn your unique talents into opportunities.\nAnd we're back on my career.\nPatsy residuals aren't gonna cover your mortgage, baby girl.\nYou're my mother, not my agent.\n- The phone rings, I answer.\n- Uh-huh.\nIronically, the calls increased after you blew up your radio show.\nIronically, I don't care.\nThey are offering you a spot on a celebrity dance show.\n- No.\n- You've always moved so well.\nNot happening.\nFashion.\nYou like fashion.\nUsually.\nThere is a clothing company in Tampa.\nThey are looking for a face for their new collection.\nAre you done? Well, you could run for president.\nA petition's being circulated online.\nWell, consider that my retirement plan.\nAll right, I will find something else.\nNo.\nI am pursuing something on my own.\nPlease don't say, \"Chekhov in the Park.\n\" It's not on camera or on a stage.\nWell, honey, you're a performer.\nWithout that, you're - Nothing? - No.\nJust unemployable.\nI gotta go.\n- Oh I've only had you 20 minutes.\n- I'll call you.\nDon't shut me out like Jessica's shutting you out.\nYou're just kicking the dog.\nI'm not shutting you out, and you're no dog.\n- I'll call you.\n- [SCOFFS.]\nPats.\n[OFFICER 1 ON SCANNER.]\nSeven Lincoln one, 10-52.\nCrescent Heights apartments in the 200 block of 7th.\nRP is manager.\n[MAN GRUNTING.]\n[OFFICER 2.]\nWe've got a noise complaint on 112th and Amsterdam.\nBack off! [OFFICER 3.]\nNeighbors are reporting music too loud.\nNorthwest corner of Washington and Spring.\n[MEN LAUGHING.]\n[OFFICER 4.]\nWe've got a belligerent passenger yelling obscenities at a bus driver.\n[OFFICER 5.]\nCopy, 42 Charlie.\nA purse was taken out of a parked car in the driveway.\nBlack sedan, already has one ticket on it.\n[OFFICER 6.]\nSubject is drunk and disorderly.\n- Subject is drunk and disorderly.\n- [MAN.]\nHey, sweetheart.\n[OFFICER 7.]\nWe've got a break-in at Sally's Pets on 45th and 7th.\nCats released.\n[OFFICER 8.]\nCaller claims his neighbor is urinating on his Prius.\n[OFFICER 9.]\nNeed evidence tech.\nRecovered some items [CELL PHONE CHIMES.]\n[TRISH.]\nAt least one of us is making a difference.\n[DISPATCHER.]\n10-31, 10-31.\nRobbery in progress at 9th Avenue and 45th.\nWitness reports two armed suspects.\n[OFFICER.]\nOne-three King en route.\n[DISPATCHER.]\nAll units be advised, witnesses reporting shots fired.\n- Out of the way! - [MAN.]\nMove! Shit.\n[POLICE SIRENS BLARING.]\n- [BRAKES SCREECH.]\n- [SIREN WHOOPS.]\n[OFFICER ON RADIO.]\nOne-three King, on scene.\nSuspects in custody.\nNo casualties.\n- [OFFICER 1.]\nYou guys got this? - Shit.\n[OFFICER 2.]\nYeah, we got it.\nLet's move.\n- Come on.\n- [OFFICER 3.]\nMove it.\n- [DISPATCHER.]\nAny available unit - Watch your head.\nwe've got a woman trapped in her bathroom by a rat.\n[OFFICER 1.]\nAll right, he's good.\n[OFFICER ON RADIO.]\nThis is 33.\nTaking report of a stolen bike outside a convenience store at East 30th Street and 2nd Avenue.\n[LINE RINGING.]\nAnswer.\n[JESSICA OVER RECORDING.]\nAlias Investigations.\nLeave a message.\n[BEEP.]\nJess [MAN.]\nStop! Hey! Hey, you! Stop! He stole my phone! [GRUNTS.]\nMy head.\nYou took something that doesn't belong to you.\nGet off me.\nNow that might not be a big deal to you, but you make people feel powerless.\nAnd that makes you a piece of shit.\n- Patsy? - What? N-No.\nHoly shit.\nIt is.\nIt's Patsy.\nNot me, asshole.\n- I'm not blind.\n- This isn't a debate.\n[GROANS.]\nMy neck.\nI think you sprained it.\nGood.\nYou need to be stopped.\nScrew you.\nYour show sucked.\nThat's him! My God.\nYou got him! He took my phone.\nOh.\nThank God.\nMy whole life is on this thing.\nThank you.\nYou're welcome.\nPatsy? [GROANS.]\nHell no.\n[PANTING.]\n- Aren't you Trish Walker? - Not today.\n- But you are Trish Walker? - Yeah.\nI'm just here to train.\nAs Trish Walker? Sure.\nJesus.\n- Is that a yes? - Oh, for Chrissake, yes.\nI am here training as Trish Walker, because I am Trish Walker.\nOkay? Perfect.\n[SIGHS.]\nWhat's this? You've been served.\nGod damn it.\nIt's obnoxious, but it's not illegal.\nIt's extortion.\nThe plaintiff's lawyer is a joke.\nHe probably found him on the side of a bus, but his case does have merit.\nHow does he have a case at all? I caught him with stolen property.\n- You assaulted a stranger.\n- A thief.\nHe stole a cell phone.\n- Well, was it your phone? - No.\n- Did you actually see him steal the phone? - I heard yelling.\nAnd then you beat up a man you saw jogging down the street.\nRunning.\nHe was trying to get away.\nOkay.\nThe victim, can he corroborate any of this? I didn't get his information.\nOkay, we can make an argument for self-defense.\nBeing a Good Samaritan.\nHe could've come after you.\nI didn't give him the chance.\nI'm certified in Krav Maga.\nStop talking.\nOkay, the odds are bad, but some battles are worth fighting.\nI'm surprised that Jessica never warned you away from me.\nShe did.\nShe called you a Prada-wearing python, but you've earned her respect.\nIt's hard to come by.\nI don't work piecemeal.\nIf you retain my services, it will be to represent you in all areas.\nI won't need a defense lawyer after this.\nWell, you you could use an entertainment lawyer.\nI'm building a new division with a very select client list.\nYou are a celebrity.\nBarely.\nAnd first things first.\nIs our investigator in the building? Have him come see me.\nOur risk management specialist will find leverage against the plaintiff.\nI suspect you'll have to pay something.\nI'll work at getting that settlement number down.\nBallpark? The perception is that you are rich and entitled.\nHigh six figures.\nI'm living off my savings.\nI can barely afford you.\nTake stock of your assets.\nDecide what you can liquidate, or a judge will decide for you.\n- [KNOCK AT DOOR.]\n- Come on in.\n[DOOR OPENS.]\n[DOOR CLOSES.]\n[HOGARTH.]\nThis is our investigator.\nI I believe you two know each other, don't you? Being this guy is a mugger, he probably lays low.\nMight take a little while to dig up dirt on him.\n- You seem comfortable here.\n- I am.\nThe hope is we'll find something that threatens to put him in jail.\n- You're obviously doing well.\nArmani? - Zegna.\nLong way from an hourly at Alias.\nNot far enough.\nYou mind if we just keep this to business? Sure.\nShutting me out is popular these days.\nAnd you don't think I have good reason? Absolutely.\nI totally screwed up with you, but [DOOR CLOSES.]\nBut I also stopped a killer.\nJessica stopped a killer.\nNo, she didn't.\nIt was me.\nI pulled the trigger.\n[SCOFFS.]\nYou killed Jessica's mother? A mass murderer, yeah.\n[SCOFFS.]\nOkay.\nYeah, wow.\nWell, that's a lot.\nYou think it was wrong.\nHey, I couldn't live with it, but clearly it hasn't slowed you down.\nStill chasing bad guys.\nWho you protect as an investigator for a defense attorney.\nYou keep a lot of guilty people out of jail.\nIt is not our job to determine guilt.\nBut you know.\nDoesn't it bother you? Anyone getting away with it who shouldn't? I'm not doing this with you again, Trish.\n- Doing what? - I know your moves.\nYou will hurt as many people as you help.\nWell, at least I'm trying.\nI'm sorry you gave up.\nI'm not giving up.\nI'm just getting there my own way.\nStarting with this job, earning my bones.\nYou do it your way, but you should probably keep us on retainer given that we keep \"guilty people out of jail.\n\" I'll be in touch.\n[ELEVATOR DINGS.]\n[ELEVATOR OPENS.]\nOh Let me get the door for you.\nThanks.\nOh [GRUNTS.]\nMy goodness.\nLet me help you with that.\n[KNOCKING AT DOOR.]\n[TRISH SIGHS.]\nDear God.\nYou scared me.\nWell, the door was unlocked.\nIt doesn't even have a lock.\nI got tired of living in a vault.\nWell, no wonder you haven't invited me over.\nI've been meaning to.\n- Well, it's a hovel.\n- It's a semiconverted loft.\nOkay, it's not converted, but it's it's got great bones.\nYeah.\nProbably the actual bones of some homeless junkie.\nYou have to picture it with a fresh coat of paint.\nYou're gonna put a fresh coat of paint on that view? Well, it still gets fantastic light.\nYou really have the knack of seeing the toilet bowl half full.\nThe realtor says this area's gonna be hotter than Williamsburg after a recession or two.\n[CHUCKLES.]\nAnd you believed her? Cinder blocks.\nJesus.\nOh, good Christ! Oh, ew! What is that? No.\nYou can't live here.\nThis is not how a Walker keeps up appearances.\nThen I found the right place.\nHaven't you lost enough? Your job.\nYour fianc\u00c3\u00a9.\nAnd now your gorgeous apartment.\nI didn't lose those things, I left them.\nBig difference.\nHoney, is this about the money? In part, but the sale of my old apartment will cover me.\nIt'll cover a lot more than this dump.\nI have other expenses.\nShould I be worried? That I'm simplifying my life? No.\nThere is a difference between simple and bleak.\nSomething is going on with you.\nJust let me help you, Pats.\n[INHALES DEEPLY.]\nOkay.\n- You can start in the bathroom.\n- What? That toilet's not gonna scrub itself.\n- Oh, this isn't funny.\n- Well, you said you wanted to help.\nWould you rather start in the kitchen? Because the oven is a disaster.\nSweetheart, whatever it is you are trying to accomplish, you cannot do it alone.\nI know, Mom.\nWell, it has been a while, but I can still scrub off grime like nobody's business.\nYou're relentless.\nPot, kettle, black, baby girl.\nGod damn.\nBroke a nail.\n[TRISH.]\nI've envied your powers, but never the P.\nI.\nstuff.\nStalking out suspects for weeks on end? Like watching paint dry.\nProbably why you like it being alone, keeping people at a distance, focusing on someone else's shit so you don't have to look at your own.\n[TRISH.]\nWhat are you doing? Jesus.\nJesus.\nUh Okay.\nDon't drink that.\nShit.\nShit.\nShit.\n[STAMMERING.]\nUh The plan.\nWhat's the plan? Damn it.\n[SIGHS.]\n[LINE RINGING.]\n[JESSICA OVER RECORDING.]\nAlias Investigations.\nLeave a message.\n[BEEP.]\n[WOMAN PANTS.]\n[GROANS.]\nAm I sick? You're gonna be fine, Birdie.\nHey.\nYou just need some rest, all right? Here.\nI was I You okay? - Am I still Birdie? - Yeah, that's you, babe.\nUh, I'm cold.\nWe'll keep each other warm.\n[BIRDIE.]\nNo.\nNo.\nStop.\nNo.\n- [TRISH GRUNTS.]\n- [MAN GROANS.]\nNot this time, asshole.\n[GROANS.]\n- [TRISH.]\nHey.\nWake up.\n- [BIRDIE MOANS SOFTLY.]\nHey, stay with me.\nYou have to focus.\nI'm gonna ralph.\nYou've been drugged, but you're okay.\nJust give me a heads-up if you're actually gonna ralph.\nUh who are you? I'm here to help.\nI will stay with you until the police get here.\nWhy? What What happened? Your friend Reid put something in your drink and brought you here to rape you.\nHe's done it before, but got off on a technicality.\nRich parents.\nFancy lawyer.\nIt was a matter of time before he did it again.\n- Oh, my God.\n- Listen to me.\nYour friends saw you two together earlier tonight.\nThey saw you flirting with each other, and they saw you leave together.\nAll of which made Reid think he could get away with it, but he won't.\n- Wait.\nOh, God.\nDid he - No.\nNo.\nBecause you fought him off.\n- What? - Whoa, whoa.\nCareful, careful.\n- [STAMMERS.]\nI fought him off? - Yes.\nYou have to make sure the police give you a tox screen.\n- [SCREAMING.]\nAsshole! - [GRUNTS.]\n[INDISTINCT POLICE CHATTER.]\nYou're welcome.\n[CHUCKLES.]\n[TRISH.]\nHow many wins will it take to redeem myself with you? Ten? A hundred? Let's start with one.\n[ELEVATOR DINGS.]\n[KNOCKING AT DOOR.]\n- [JESSICA.]\nHey.\n- [OSCAR.]\nYou busy? I'm a half a bottle into my work.\nWhat's up? Well, you left this at my place.\nYou could've sent Vido down with it.\nBut you have something else on your mind.\nDo you ever stop thinking like a P.\nI.\n? [CHUCKLES.]\nThat's why I hate magic.\nI always figured out the trick.\nAlso magicians.\n[OSCAR.]\nNo, magicians are awful.\n[JESSICA.]\nSo? I wanted to talk to you about our friendship.\n- I mean, that's what it is now, right? - I guess so.\nI'm not sure what happened.\nYou're a good guy.\nThat's what happened.\n[CHUCKLES.]\n[OSCAR CHUCKLES.]\nWell, you must be doing something right, because Vido loves the shit out of you.\nYou know I'm only friends with you to be friends with him, right? I'll take it.\nWell I just wanted to get that out in the open before I moved on.\nYou met someone? I thought you should know, in case we run into each other in the elevator or something.\nIt's all good.\nThat's nice, having someone you can let in that lets you in, too.\nYeah, that is the one trick I never quite figured out.\nHow to let someone in without it ending badly.\n- It's worth a try.\n- Not if they end up dead.\n[OSCAR.]\nJess, your mother loved every minute with you.\nI could see that on her face.\nI think you're kind of proving my point.\n[OSCAR.]\nYou don't think she wanted that time? Even if she knew how it was gonna end? [JESSICA.]\nCan we just not talk about it? Okay? [OSCAR.]\nOkay.\n[CHAIN CLINKING.]\n[TRAINER.]\nMm-hmm.\nCome on, you got this.\nFive more seconds.\n[GRUNTS.]\nYeah.\n- All right.\nGot it.\nGood job.\n- [TRISH PANTS.]\nHey, easy.\nTake a break.\n[PANTING.]\n- Trish, slow the hell down.\n- [GRUNTS.]\n[GRUNTS.]\n- Okay, ready? - Got more? [TRAINER CHUCKLES.]\n[BOTH PANTING.]\nTake it off.\nI'll wash it.\nDo you even have a washing machine? Take it off.\n[REPORTER.]\nin the evening with skies remaining cloudy, but dry overnight.\nExpected temperatures to remain below freezing into next week, - when we should finally see - You're still here.\nI made some coffee.\nYeah.\nListen, Adrian, I, uh I have a lot of work.\nUm It's [REPORTER.]\nbrutal attack this morning.\nMadeline Brandt was asleep when intruders broke in and assaulted her, stealing a valuable sculpture.\nPolice have arrested Ms.\nBrandt's half-brother, Andrew Brandt.\nYou hear about this piece of shit? Hired a couple thugs to beat the crap out of his half-sister.\nWhy? She inherited the one thing he wanted.\nHe got everything else, but not this stupid sculpture.\n[REPORTER.]\nremains in critical condition at Metro-General Hospital See, that's why I box, so I can molly whop assholes like him.\n- \"Molly whop\"? - It's a saying.\n[BOTH CHUCKLE.]\n[KNOCKING AT DOOR.]\n- Who is it? - [MALCOLM.]\nIt's me.\nOh, crap.\nUh Yeah, I have an appointment I forgot.\nYeah.\nUm workout Thursday? You know, I'll call you.\n[SCOFFS.]\nSleep with the client, lose the client.\nColorful neighborhood.\nI wanted a change.\nI just came here to get a check off you for the cell phone thief.\nSo he gets paid? What happens next? - It's over.\n- [SCOFFS.]\nSteal what you can, sue for the rest.\nGotta love American justice.\n- How much? - Fifty grand.\nThat's a lot less than Hogarth expected.\nI got him to back down.\nYou must have found some significant dirt.\nWhat was it? No.\nI don't have time to get into that.\n- What did you find? - Does it matter? It's my case.\nI want to know how bad the guy is.\nHe's got a rap sheet going back to high school.\nAssault, robbery, DUI.\nServed his time, so that wasn't useful.\nHowever, he is a family guy.\nMarried, 12-year-old boy.\nAnd that's useful? Not on the surface, but the kid worships him.\nHe doesn't give a shit that his dad's an ex-con.\nHe's still a hero.\nSo I dug deeper, and it turns out Mom and Dad have been lying to the kid for his whole life.\nHe's not this kid's dad at all.\nJust some guy who came into the picture when the kid was a baby.\nHe fell in love with the boy and raised him as his own.\nSo I gave him a simple choice.\nI could enlighten his son, or he could reconsider his settlement demands.\nHe thought I was bluffing.\nTill I pulled up the kid's cell phone number, called him.\nI asked I asked the kid if his dad had ever told him what a bastard is.\nDesperation in his dad's eyes.\nCrying, begging me to hang up.\n[SIGHS.]\nAnd all I thought was, \"I got you.\n\" And what would you have done if he refused to negotiate? I would've told the kid everything.\nI got the job done.\n[CLEARS THROAT.]\nIt's what it takes.\nTo earn a paycheck? Prove myself to Hogarth.\nNever do anything like that on my behalf again.\nEver.\nDon't you look at me like I'm the one going off the goddamn rails, all right? - You're not fooling anyone.\n- I'm working on a project.\nI know what your screwed-up idea of a project is.\nI don't owe you an explanation.\nTell that to TMZ when they ask, \"Where's Patsy now?\" - They're not asking.\n- They will.\nAnd you better find a good answer to that question, 'cause right now you look one meltdown away from a psych ward.\n[DOOR OPENS.]\n[DOOR CLOSES.]\nThe thing I love most about this cardigan is how it feels against your skin.\nYou know, it's light but warm.\nThe perfect outerwear for this cuckoo spring weather.\nAnd, you know, the wonderful thing about it is it's machine wash, tumble dry.\nMmm! [CHUCKLES.]\nNow, I've spent the past year perfecting a cotton blend in colors that are timeless yet versatile.\nThis cardie is my new BFF.\nNow, Sasha here is wearing the Island Breeze.\nOh, that color just pops on her.\nI mean, it just turns your basics into, like, a chic, fun outfit.\nIt's like her outfit got a promotion.\nGorgeous, Sasha.\nNow, we have Hannah on the line from Ann Arbor.\nHi, Hannah.\n[HANNAH CHUCKLING.]\nHi, Trish.\nOh, my God.\nIt's so wonderful to talk to you.\nAre you enjoying our knits? Definitely.\nI got one for my sister and one for my mom, and they both love it.\nDon't forget about yourself.\n[CHUCKLING.]\nOh, I'm not getting out a lot these days.\nI'm recently divorced.\nShe can handle it.\nI'm so sorry to hear that, Hannah, but the end of a relationship doesn't make you any less worthy of feeling beautiful and fulfilled.\nSpring is about new beginnings.\nSo show your ex what a good thing he's missing.\n- [HANNAH.]\nYou're so right.\n- [CHUCKLES.]\n- Is it still available in Bordeaux? - That's my favorite color.\nThank you so much, Trish.\nYou're welcome.\n- [MAN.]\nOff air! - God! This is so much better than hawking the ShowerBuddy.\nDon't ask.\nYou're killing it, girl.\nIf we keep selling at this rate, they'll move us out of this lousy time slot.\nOh, I asked for this time slot.\nWorks with my schedule.\n\"The case of the stolen sculpture\"? It's like bad reality TV.\nThey putting that guy in jail? They're dropping the charges against Brandt.\nYou've gotta be kidding me.\nThey couldn't find the sculpture to link him to his sister's attack.\nMeanwhile, she's drinking her meals through a straw.\nMakes you want to strangle someone with a sweater.\n- Wouldn't help her.\n- It'd help me.\nSomeone ought to call that superhero woman.\nJennifer something.\nJessica.\nGrace, you might want to talk to the wardrobe gal.\nI swear I saw a nipple through that blouse.\nKeep your head in the game, baby.\nThat's not vitaminwater.\nThis is fine.\n[SIGHS.]\nThey can't expect you to keep these hours and not provide something to keep your energy up.\n[SCOFFS.]\nI'm wide awake.\nYou have another hour to go, honey.\nAnd where are your Skittles?
