It was released alongside the album pre-order on August 17, 2017.\n\nThe song describes a breakdown in a relationship, either due to mental health issues or drug addiction (which Baker has covered in previous songs). The song incorporates a lot more instrumentation than previous songs from Baker, including guitar, piano and ambient additions as well as multiple vocal lines.\n\nThe music video was released on September 14, 2017:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBu21i9aEE9"

It was released alongside the album pre-order on August 17, 2017.\n\nThe song describes a breakdown in a relationship, either due to mental health issues or drug addiction (which Baker has covered in previous songs). The song incorporates a lot more instrumentation than previous songs from Baker, including guitar, piano and ambient additions as well as multiple vocal lines.\n\nThe music video was released on September 14, 2017:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBu21i9aEE9"

By turning out the lights, you\u2019re alone and you have to deal with things alone.\n\nIn an interview with Face Culture, Baker explained how the song externalized the feelings she experienced while on tour. She said, \u201cI think writing that song and externalizing how I was feeling: that I was feeling isolated and saying, like, you know, \u201cwhenever it\u2019s time to go to bed, and I turn out the lights, I have to confront all the parts of myself that I haven\u2019t quite come to terms with yet\u201d helped me do that. It helped me confront the things about myself that I might think are ugly or a problem and realize that I can embrace those things.\u201d\n\nThe official video was released on 11th October 2017 and depicts Baker following a fuse to a burning piano.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV1dMqeb4_U"

By turning out the lights, you\u2019re alone and you have to deal with things alone.\n\nIn an interview with Face Culture, Baker explained how the song externalized the feelings she experienced while on tour. She said, \u201cI think writing that song and externalizing how I was feeling: that I was feeling isolated and saying, like, you know, \u201cwhenever it\u2019s time to go to bed, and I turn out the lights, I have to confront all the parts of myself that I haven\u2019t quite come to terms with yet\u201d helped me do that. It helped me confront the things about myself that I might think are ugly or a problem and realize that I can embrace those things.\u201d\n\nThe official video was released on 11th October 2017 and depicts Baker following a fuse to a burning piano.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV1dMqeb4_U"

Some of them are about almost dying or being afraid of death or a relationship dying. I remember exactly when I wrote that. I was sitting in my dorm and it was almost a joke with myself. I was just writing these sad, bummer songs, and it was like, What is wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I feel better? I wish I could write about something happy. I wish I could write something other than songs about frickin\u2019 death. What if I just say that lyric in the song? I texted the lyrics to one of my friends, and he was like, \u201cI love it!\u201d So I kept it and it\u2019s good because it\u2019s an endeavor of mine to write songs about more significant things.

In musical terms, this song marks a further departure from the Tennessee singer-songwriter\u2019s earlier, stripped-down sound, prominently featuring drums and uncharacteristically lush instrumental breaks. In an interview for KEXP, Julien Baker has said that when writing this song, she wanted it to be one \u201cto bang your head to\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2TxfBSmjs"

In musical terms, this song marks a further departure from the Tennessee singer-songwriter\u2019s earlier, stripped-down sound, prominently featuring drums and uncharacteristically lush instrumental breaks. In an interview for KEXP, Julien Baker has said that when writing this song, she wanted it to be one \u201cto bang your head to\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2TxfBSmjs"

Even though she may be cognizant that an apology pre-incident isn\u2019t truly an apology, she uses it as a way to prepare loved ones for her behaviours, as well as a way to distance herself and put up a wall. This in turn fuels her self-destructive behaviours, as loneliness is often a reason many \u201cruin\u201d things.\n\nI think this line also has a depressive hint in it, in which Julien is not yet fully accepting of recovery. The apologies hint that she knows her behaviour is harmful, but she is using them in order to continue the pattern of behaviour, rather than attempting to stop whatever actions she may be apologising for. This could be referring to her relapse, in which she no longer is actively trying to get better, but instead is trying to get away with \u201cruining everything\u201d."

As her voice swells accordingly, it\u2019s here that she formally acknowledges the pain of feeling betrayed (or, at least, unrequited affection).\n\nJumping from \u201cI thought I meant something\u201d to \u201cI just said nothing\u201d serves to drive home her desperation in that critical moment preceding the song. She knows full well that the right words probably wouldn\u2019t have saved the relationship, but in her pain, it\u2019s easy to entertain the idea that everything could be okay. As is clear to us, though, it\u2019s not really about that one moment, that\u2019s just the culmination of everything before it.\n\nThe power of this song comes from how well Julien alludes to all of the various emotions jumping around in the aftermath of what was presumably a breakup. Here, it\u2019s easier for her to cope by redirecting her anger at herself for not saying \u201cthe right words\u201d than it is to face feeling worthless in the eyes of her love."

If there is an auditory equivalent to getting punched in the face, the silence from the absence of her love interest is it."

The speaker longs for substance to fulfill the desires of their own desire, the loved object. And yet, the speaker only finds lack, unable to \u2018find something to say.\u2019 The speaker, in a quest for presence, merely deploys absence: \u2018nothing, nothing, nothing.\u2019\n\nThis is the central paradox of the song, which the first stanza alerts the listener to. The song is a metaphorical labyrinth, a vessel that traps the loved object, and while the speaker purports to have \u2018nothing\u2019 to say, they in fact have produced presence from absence. Inactivity, saying \u2018nothing,\u2019 which cannot satisfy and retain the loved object and sustain the romance, produces activity, which is the song itself.\n\nThe inability to speak, especially in important moments or to important people, is a subject Julien has also touched in other songs such as Sprained Ankle.\n\nSpilling my guts\nSweat on a microphone, breaking my voice\nWhenever I\u2019m alone with you, can\u2019t talk but\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this weather nice?

One cannot help but be reminded of a line from Judith Butler\u2019s Precarious Life:\n\n\u2018When we lose certain people, or when we are dispossessed from a place, or a community, we may simply feel that we are undergoing something temporary, that mourning will be over and some restoration of prior order will be achieved. But maybe when we undergo what we do, something about who we are is revealed, something that delineates the ties we have to others, that shows us that these ties constitute what we are, ties or bonds that compose us. It is not as if an \u201cI\u201d exists independently over here and then simply loses a \u201cyou\u201d over there, especially if the attachment to \u201cyou\u201d is part of what composes who \u201cI\u201d am. If I lose you, under these conditions, then I not only mourn the loss, but I become inscrutable to myself. Who \u201cam\u201d I, without you? When we lose some of these ties by which we are constituted, we do not know who we are or what to do. On one level, I think I have lost \u201cyou\u201d only to discover that \u201cI\u201d have gone missing as well.\u2019\n\nIndeed, the song insists on a Butlarian ethics that questions the grievability and unmournability of loss."

In contradistinction to a maze\u2013a series of paths that leads to an exit\u2013a labyrinth is contains no real end, less its entrance. It\u2019s a symbol of futility and hopelessness.\n\nAs the song\u2019s protagonist considers their relationship past, they feel their head begin to collapse in on itself, offering no way out; no new possibility for their relationship.\n\nAt the same time, the labyrinth is a metaphorical and physical vessel for the objects it holds: rather than killing his bastard son, Minos imprisons him in a space that paradoxically has an unattainable exit. In similar fashion, the song\u2019s protagonist has fashioned, in their mind at least, a vessel for their loved object who has since left. This is reinforced in the final line of the song, in which the protagonist insists that they \u2018won\u2019t think of anyone else\u2019"

              "\u201cPoison\u201d is a term often used for alcohol. The origin of sayings such as \u201cPick your poison\u201d comes from poison being used as slang while telling people to choose an alcoholic beverage. In many depictions, alcohol is shown with caution or warning labels as if it\u2019s poisonous. One iconic depiction is moonshine, which would be marked with an X per distillation, with each distillation increasing the alcoholic content. Three Xs meant it had been distilled three times, practically rendering pure alcohol.\n\nAdditionally, consuming high amounts of something aromatic can lead to smelling like that substance. Alcoholics frequently smell like alcohol due to this, even when freshly showered, as the body can deal with the excess alcohol by pushing it through the skin.\n\nBaker is saying that their partner drinks so heavily she can practically see the alcohol seeping out of their pores. It\u2019s both a gruesome visual and a testament to the damage her partner\u2019s alcoholism is doing to them."

It\u2019s nostalgic, and as I was recording the end of that we had these two directional mics set up while I played piano into the pre-amp. And then I hear this like, crackly TV noise and the dialogue happening through my headphones. Well, it wasn\u2019t dialogue but the guy was talking. I just finish off the thing, the arrangement and everyone tells me that the pre-amp was picking up church radio, as I was playing. [\u2026] It was like a Twilight Zone thing, and I decided to leave it in there because it was such a cool, organic happening. It\u2019s just so crazy, given the context of the record, that this happened to be a quintessential Southern preacher shouting phrases that start with: \u201cBut, God!\u201d [laughs] almost like Reverend Lovejoy from The Simpsons.

                  "plain": "At the end Julien is playing \u201cIn Christ Alone\u201d, a modern Christian song, and you can hear a preacher speaking in the background. As she explained in an interview with Stereogum the latter was actually a coincidence:\n\nWe were recording that track, and the end is the piano arrangement from this hymn called \u201cIn Christ Alone.\u201d It holds a lot of memories for me \u2014 being young in church, and the lyrics hold a lot of meaning when you analyze them. It\u2019s nostalgic, and as I was recording the end of that we had these two directional mics set up while I played piano into the pre-amp. And then I hear this like, crackly TV noise and the dialogue happening through my headphones. Well, it wasn\u2019t dialogue but the guy was talking. I just finish off the thing, the arrangement and everyone tells me that the pre-amp was picking up church radio, as I was playing. [\u2026] It was like a Twilight Zone thing, and I decided to leave it in there because it was such a cool, organic happening. It\u2019s just so crazy, given the context of the record, that this happened to be a quintessential Southern preacher shouting phrases that start with: \u201cBut, God!\u201d [laughs] almost like Reverend Lovejoy from The Simpsons. It was like some holy roller shit."

              "This line is a circle back to the first verse. Now instead of being helpless due to intoxication she is helpless due to loneliness and fear. Just like she had to rely on the grace of someone who was sober to come take her to safety, now on a deeper, more spiritual level she has to rely on someone who does not have the same soul-condition that is causing this loneliness and pain to rescue her. She decides, in this line, to call her Father.\n\nThe end of the song continues with \u201cIn Christ Alone\u201d which seems to be the resolution of the song/album. She has looked everywhere for something to satisfy: music, relationships, intoxication to name a few. Christ is the only one metaphorically sober enough to rescue her from her metaphoric ditch. A sober person has nothing to gain in helping someone in a ditch find their way home. In this case Christ is only motivated by Julien\u2019s well being and having an eternal relationship with her.\n\n\u201cIn Christ alone my hope is found\nHe is my light, my strength, my song\nThis Cornerstone, this solid ground\nFirm through the fiercest drought and storm\nWhat heights of love, what depths of peace\nWhen fears are stilled, when strivings cease\nMy Comforter, my All in All\nHere in the love of Christ I stand\u201d\n\n(the preacher talking in the background was an accident so you interpret that as you please)"

              "In this line her body represents her life now and just like you take off dirty clothes in a short time, Julien\u2019s body will die in about 65 years from now or sooner but her spirit will live on. As a Christian knowing what freedom you will have when you are free from loneliness and fear in heaven, it makes it all the harder to live out your purpose on earth surrounded by pain and suffering. If you knew your body was temporary washing your hands seems useless.\n\nA more literal interpretation would be that she can\u2019t change her clothes so she just says in the ones she wore the day before. She doesn\u2019t see the point anymore. She\u2019s tired and wants to go home.\n\nThe song could be about addiction or about someone with crippling OCD. She sees herself in this line as made up entirely of dirt and filth, and is sick and tired of seeing herself that way and trying to clean herself up, when she knows she will only ever be top dirty to quell her disease.\n\nA common symptom of OCD is ritualistically and/or repetitively washing ones hands, perhaps to rid some invisible filth only the sufferer still sees on themselves. If she sees her body as dirty, though no amount of hand washing will \u2018clean\u2019 her enough to satisfy the disorder, it is a developed coping mechanism. The reference to \u2018clean[ing her] insides\u2019 with bleach, a disinfectant that is toxic when consumed, also supports this connection in her mind that self-harming = purifying."

This is evident from the final two lines in the stanza when the speaker identifies their interlocutor\u2019s worry with her own experience of not \u2018lik[ing] the things [she] sees.\u2019 This final line makes it seem that the combination of depression and lack of medication is leading to these sort of thoughts.\n\nBut the final line is hard to disentangle on syntax alone: does the speaker feel this way (alone, not liking what they\u2019re seeing), or is that simply what their interlocutor thinks (\u2018Cause I know you\u2019re still worried,\u2019 she insists). On the one hand, the first verse is a fairly explicit cry for help, or at least remembering when the speaker begged their interlocutor for help. On the other hand, this line seems more like a summary of the interlocutor\u2019s worries than the speaker\u2019s own. Perhaps the turn in the final stanza, \u2018But I\u2019ve kissed enough bathroom sinks\u2026\u2019 suggests that the speaker has already turned a new leaf and learned from their mistakes.\n\nThere\u2019s a song by Forrister, Julien\u2019s other band, named Choked Up that came out in early 2015, with a similar section. In that,  Julien sings\n\nSo if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019ve been taking my medicine.\nWasted, stay the nights on your floor in my clothes.\nYou hide all your knives; the bad dreams and the whiskey.\nTell your friends don\u2019t miss me,\nI know you don\u2019t.

It could also simply be metaphorical, in that she has stopped fully and honestly communicating, hiding internal problems from those around her.\n An alternative explanation might be that in the first stanza she recognizes that she needs help from God and calls out to him, but she stops praying to God for help, likely falling back into old habits when she says quits talking again."
