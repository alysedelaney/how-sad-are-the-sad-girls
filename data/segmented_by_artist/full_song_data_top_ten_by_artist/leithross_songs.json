It was first teased on October 10th, 2021 when Ross posted a short video to TikTok wherein they performed the first and second verses of the song acoustically.\n\nThe link to pre-save the song was then made available on November 4th, 2022, accompanying a tweet announcing its release on the 11th.\n\nThe release of the song was accompanied by a music video, a lyric video, and an Instagram post from Ross wherein they said the following:\n\nOrlando song and video are out. Joey and I had so much fun making this song into what it is, I hope you will listen to it in your cars and on your bikes and feel very very majestic and awesome. Thank you for always listening to and being so kind about my art and my feelings. Joey Landreth, you are the bestest friend and music buddy that the world has ever known and making music with you makes everything feel nice. My dear music video team, Adam Kelly, Jen Doerksen, Louis, DFC, thank you so much for bringing my little gay love story to life, you mean so much to me, To Roman Clarke, for adding a little extra something on here too, I love you so much.\n\nWhen speaking about the inspiration behind the song, they said:\n\nThis one goes out to everyone who\u2019s been in a failed situationship and you can\u2019t figure out what happened."

It was first teased on October 10th, 2021 when Ross posted a short video to TikTok wherein they performed the first and second verses of the song acoustically.\n\nThe link to pre-save the song was then made available on November 4th, 2022, accompanying a tweet announcing its release on the 11th.\n\nThe release of the song was accompanied by a music video, a lyric video, and an Instagram post from Ross wherein they said the following:\n\nOrlando song and video are out. Joey and I had so much fun making this song into what it is, I hope you will listen to it in your cars and on your bikes and feel very very majestic and awesome. Thank you for always listening to and being so kind about my art and my feelings. Joey Landreth, you are the bestest friend and music buddy that the world has ever known and making music with you makes everything feel nice. My dear music video team, Adam Kelly, Jen Doerksen, Louis, DFC, thank you so much for bringing my little gay love story to life, you mean so much to me, To Roman Clarke, for adding a little extra something on here too, I love you so much.\n\nWhen speaking about the inspiration behind the song, they said:\n\nThis one goes out to everyone who\u2019s been in a failed situationship and you can\u2019t figure out what happened."

            "plain": "Trigger warning: Sexual Assault\n\n\u2018Guts\u2019 is the 4th single from singer-songwriter Leith Ross' debut record. The track was first teased on June 8th, 2021 in a video on TikTok wherein Ross sat in front of the camera and sang the first chorus of the song. They captioned the video:\n\nwrote this about a terrible man who had such a terrible effect on my life but playing it is so therapeutic. eff that guy\n\nThe first and second verse of the song (along with the chorus) was also played acoustically before the release in a video on TikTok posted on November 11th, 2021. It was captioned with five frowning faces.\n\nOn February 2nd, 2023, Ross uploaded a third video to TikTok wherein they performed the second chorus and the post-chorus. The video was captioned:\n\nI wrote this song because I found out that the mother of someone who assaulted me was a nurse who cared for my grandfather when he was in hospice care. By all accounts, she is apparently a lovely woman and I think about it a lot. It\u2019s also just about processing the anger and grief that comes after experiencing that kind of violence and its fallout. I can\u2019t wait to share the rest of the song with you even though it\u2019s also nerve-wracking.\n\nThey posted another snippet of the song on TikTok shortly after but later removed it, stating the following on Twitter:\n\nJust posted a silly video to promote the new song because I felt like I had to but the song is about me experiencing sexual violence, and I immediately felt horrible and deleted it. I just wanna say \u2013 it\u2019s important to have self-check-ins and boundaries when engaged with the internet, especially with our current landscape of self-promotion in music and arts. It\u2019s an awesome tool but it shouldn\u2019t come before your comfort or at your expense.\n\nThe link to pre-save the song was then made available on March 7th, 2023 and the release date was announced six days later.\n\nA few hours before the actual release, Ross posted the following message on both Twitter and Instagram:\n\nThere is a song coming out tonight that is one of the more vulnerable things I\u2019ve ever released so I just want to preface it a bit/give myself a chance to say some things before it is out in the world. This song is about the times in my life that I have been sexually assaulted/experienced any kind of sexual violence, and the ways that the people in my life have let me down after those events occurred. When I wrote it, it was to give myself permission to feel the whole range of emotions that started to consume me. It has a lot of rage, hurt, defeat, betrayal, and even forgiveness. And as much as I still hold so much anger and hurt and always will, I also just want to say that I wish for all of us, from an early age, care, tenderness, easy access to good and comprehensive FREE sex education, community, housing, free and accessible therapy and all forms of mental health care, a healthcare system that is far more just and far better at protecting/healing people than the current system we have in place, love, generosity, safe injection sites, the decriminalization of sex work, community centers with resources and without cops, and the list goes on and on. Because god knows this kind of violence is preventable and we are being failed by the systems that claim to protect us. Which, on that note, I also want to express my intense grief and love for people who have been failed by the \u201cjustice\u201d system and by the police in this respect. Both the courts and the cops allow, perpetuate, and commit sexual violence upon our most vulnerable community members and they do not keep us safe. All this to say: practice harm reduction, keep each other safe, musicians: you know who amongst you is actively inflicting harm, and shame on you for looking the other way in the name of talent or status. And be good to each other. I love people so much, I really do, and I\u2019m terrified and grateful and lucky enough to be able to share parts of this experience safely and publicly. To my friends and family who never wavered, who made me feel safe, I\u2019d never be at this point without you. To Joey Landreth who cried with me and gave me his time and heart to help me figure out how to translate these feelings into sound, words cannot express how grateful I am! And to all the amazing musicians who played on this, it wouldn\u2019t be what it is without you.\n\nOnce the song was released, Ross took to Twitter to announce that the cover art used for the single was actually going to be the same art used for their first full-length debut record, and the release date for said record was May 19th, 2023."

                  "plain": "Trigger warning: Sexual Assault\n\n\u2018Guts\u2019 is the 4th single from singer-songwriter Leith Ross' debut record. The track was first teased on June 8th, 2021 in a video on TikTok wherein Ross sat in front of the camera and sang the first chorus of the song. They captioned the video:\n\nwrote this about a terrible man who had such a terrible effect on my life but playing it is so therapeutic. eff that guy\n\nThe first and second verse of the song (along with the chorus) was also played acoustically before the release in a video on TikTok posted on November 11th, 2021. It was captioned with five frowning faces.\n\nOn February 2nd, 2023, Ross uploaded a third video to TikTok wherein they performed the second chorus and the post-chorus. The video was captioned:\n\nI wrote this song because I found out that the mother of someone who assaulted me was a nurse who cared for my grandfather when he was in hospice care. By all accounts, she is apparently a lovely woman and I think about it a lot. It\u2019s also just about processing the anger and grief that comes after experiencing that kind of violence and its fallout. I can\u2019t wait to share the rest of the song with you even though it\u2019s also nerve-wracking.\n\nThey posted another snippet of the song on TikTok shortly after but later removed it, stating the following on Twitter:\n\nJust posted a silly video to promote the new song because I felt like I had to but the song is about me experiencing sexual violence, and I immediately felt horrible and deleted it. I just wanna say \u2013 it\u2019s important to have self-check-ins and boundaries when engaged with the internet, especially with our current landscape of self-promotion in music and arts. It\u2019s an awesome tool but it shouldn\u2019t come before your comfort or at your expense.\n\nThe link to pre-save the song was then made available on March 7th, 2023 and the release date was announced six days later.\n\nA few hours before the actual release, Ross posted the following message on both Twitter and Instagram:\n\nThere is a song coming out tonight that is one of the more vulnerable things I\u2019ve ever released so I just want to preface it a bit/give myself a chance to say some things before it is out in the world. This song is about the times in my life that I have been sexually assaulted/experienced any kind of sexual violence, and the ways that the people in my life have let me down after those events occurred. When I wrote it, it was to give myself permission to feel the whole range of emotions that started to consume me. It has a lot of rage, hurt, defeat, betrayal, and even forgiveness. And as much as I still hold so much anger and hurt and always will, I also just want to say that I wish for all of us, from an early age, care, tenderness, easy access to good and comprehensive FREE sex education, community, housing, free and accessible therapy and all forms of mental health care, a healthcare system that is far more just and far better at protecting/healing people than the current system we have in place, love, generosity, safe injection sites, the decriminalization of sex work, community centers with resources and without cops, and the list goes on and on. Because god knows this kind of violence is preventable and we are being failed by the systems that claim to protect us. Which, on that note, I also want to express my intense grief and love for people who have been failed by the \u201cjustice\u201d system and by the police in this respect. Both the courts and the cops allow, perpetuate, and commit sexual violence upon our most vulnerable community members and they do not keep us safe. All this to say: practice harm reduction, keep each other safe, musicians: you know who amongst you is actively inflicting harm, and shame on you for looking the other way in the name of talent or status. And be good to each other. I love people so much, I really do, and I\u2019m terrified and grateful and lucky enough to be able to share parts of this experience safely and publicly. To my friends and family who never wavered, who made me feel safe, I\u2019d never be at this point without you. To Joey Landreth who cried with me and gave me his time and heart to help me figure out how to translate these feelings into sound, words cannot express how grateful I am! And to all the amazing musicians who played on this, it wouldn\u2019t be what it is without you.\n\nOnce the song was released, Ross took to Twitter to announce that the cover art used for the single was actually going to be the same art used for their first full-length debut record, and the release date for said record was May 19th, 2023."

It was released on August 7th of 2020 and the music video came out a short while after, being posted to Youtube on August 21st of the same year.\n\nRoss said that this song was sort of a comment on their generation\u2019s way of forming connections:\n\n\u201cMy generation has a habit of sacrificing and undermining the power of physical touch and human connection. I am the person who strikes up a conversation with every single nice-looking old person on the subway, and I was losing sight of that. This is a song that mourns all the things I would\u2019ve missed out on had I not come to that realization.\u201d"

It was released on August 7th of 2020 and the music video came out a short while after, being posted to Youtube on August 21st of the same year.\n\nRoss said that this song was sort of a comment on their generation\u2019s way of forming connections:\n\n\u201cMy generation has a habit of sacrificing and undermining the power of physical touch and human connection. I am the person who strikes up a conversation with every single nice-looking old person on the subway, and I was losing sight of that. This is a song that mourns all the things I would\u2019ve missed out on had I not come to that realization.\u201d"

They then begin to think about the negative ways that the people around them may interpret their actions.\n\nRoss' height isn\u2019t public knowledge (as far as I know) but this verse implies that they are on the shorter side. Instead of just sitting down at the bar they have to climb onto the barstool which can be a bit awkward. This causes them to worry that the other people in the bar are judging them and think they look stupid."

And while these options are still available for most people, now we can just download an app or send a text and get our food dropped off right outside the door so we don\u2019t have to go anywhere or talk to anyone.\n\nGetting books sent to your door is a similar story. It used to be much more common to go out in public, to a library or a store, and actually look through all of the aisles and pick out which books you wanted to get. However, now we can get any book we want with the touch of our fingers. We don\u2019t need to go out shopping when we can just open up our laptops, search for the title of a book, and then buy it. While this may be more convenient, something is lost there too."

These moments are placed directly after each other as a comment on how fast we grow up.\n\nMost people learn to walk sometime between about ten and eighteen months old and lose their first tooth when they are around six or seven.\n\nThere is usually a significant amount of time that passes in between these events but looking back, you might not really account for all of that time."

              "The first thing to note about this line is that the narrator says they used to pray to a god that they don\u2019t believe in.\n\nOne way to interpret this line is that the person singing never truly believed in god, even when they were little. However, despite their lack of faith, they were taught that they should believe in god, resulting in them consistently praying, even when though they didn\u2019t believe in whatever they were praying to.\n\nAnother interpretation is that they used to believe in god when they were younger, but somewhere along the way they stopped. This would make sense as one of the major themes throughout this song is growing up and having your beliefs change.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning when dissecting this line is that they said they were praying to grow tall. At first glance, this may seem like they are only talking about height, which could be true, but this line could also mean that they used to pray that their childhood would end soon. I think a lot of people dream of being an adult when they\u2019re younger as they imagine it grants you all the freedom and knowledge in the world and then they grow up and realize how much simpler everything was when they were a kid.\n\nRoss also touches on their experiences with religion in track four of Motherwell, a song entitled Prayer."

But then when you\u2019re older and you stumble upon past memories, it feels like they just happened and you\u2019re left wondering how time could\u2019ve passed so quickly. I also think that this is something that happens more as you get older and gain a better grasp on time and become busier, it feels like days just fly by."
