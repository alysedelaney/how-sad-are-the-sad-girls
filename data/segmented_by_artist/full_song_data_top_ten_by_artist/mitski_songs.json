This feeling of inadequacy is a common thread in much of Mitski\u2019s work.\n\nThis also shows her desire to be pursued romantically (simply kissing) and not be seen as someone who solely provides sex and performs care tasks.\n\nThe \u201cusual lipstick\u201d implies that they usually don\u2019t kiss although she wants to, so she\u2019s hoping that tonight might be an exception. This shows that there\u2019s a lack of real affection and connection in the relationship, and might imply that she\u2019s not valued in the relationship or she has things she wants to do but has not voiced out to her lover.

Washing machines clean, just as Mitski is expected to perform emotional labor for her significant other, in the process forgetting who she is, becoming almost an appliance. In the process of trying to fix her partner, her own heart is taking the damage.\n\nThe shoes in particular could allude to washing someone else\u2019s feet. In the Bible, Jesus washes the feet of his disciples as an act of humility and selflessness. This can be connected to Mitski, who feels obligated to serve her partner.\nThe shoes could also represent Mitski\u2019s partner. We wear shoes whenever we leave the house and they gather dirt everywhere we go. This could represent the emotional baggage that her partner has collected throughout their life."

              "This interlude almost feels like a momentary release, a brief surrender to the suffocating longing the narrator feels.\n\nModulation to a higher key in pop music is commonly understood to announce the song\u2019s climactic finish (see Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d for a popular example). In most of these cases, the song either maintains the new key to its conclusion or modulates again to a higher key. Here, however, the key is only briefly maintained and is quickly cut off by the outro.\n\nMitski\u2019s choice to return to the original key after modulating deprives the interlude of a satisfying resolution and instills a sense of disappointment in the listener. This mirrors the song\u2019s themes of frustration. It is a momentary lapse of restraint anxiously interrupted by a return to denial."

There\u2019s some childlike sense of adventure in the idea of walking to the top of big night sky, but she doesn\u2019t want to go home yet (feeling intoxicated) and wanders up to the top of the night sky (possibly related to the feeling like you\u2019re high or like you\u2019re floating when you\u2019re in love), but it\u2019s sandwiched between the chorus of feeling overwhelmed and too much, like you\u2019re stuck up on a ledge way up high and need to be helped off.

Yet now I find I\u2019ve grown into a tall child.\""

              "Here, Mitski explains how she felt more mature in her childhood than she does or did as an adult in this relationship. She is described as a \u201ctall\u201d child, meaning that she sees her self-worth as that of a child in an adult body. This showcases to us that the relationship she was/is in made her highly dependant (like a child). It could also mean that she finds herself being more emotional right now as an adult, than she ever did as a child.\n\nThe line \u201cI was so young when I behaved twenty five\u201d may also mean that people told her from a young age that she was very mature for her age so she adapted that into her personality in order to not disappoint them (we\u2019ve seen from songs like \u201cReal Men\u201d that she\u2019s learned to need male validation, so maybe a father figure pushed this idea on her and so she wanted to please them by acting the way they wanted her to). This led to her hiding her true feelings and probably missing out on on a lot from her childhood. Now that she she\u2019s grown, she realises the trauma these people have caused her and so she tries to live these \u201cchildish\u201d feeling she never was allowed to have."

This song is her last attempt to repair what is lost. It\u2019s to show she\u2019s not able to accept she\u2019s no longer a major role in their lives.  This song might be the aftermath of \u201cFirst Love/Late Spring,\u201d a relationship\u2019s start. There\u2019s no explanation for them breaking up. There\u2019s just her upset it happened.\n\nThough she is trying to say as much as she wants to keep herself and her improvements as a person private, she is willing to put all of that out in the open for the attention of the lover that we can assume left her.\n\nThrough the lens of romance as a metaphor for pursuing music, the chorus may also allude to Mitski not needing the audience and music industry to see how hard she\u2019s been trying, but she can\u2019t bare to leave this career path behind."

              "Kisses, and the need to be kissed, are a recurring motif throughout this album. When asked why she rarely disclosed anything more sordid, Mitski responded:\n\nI take everything seriously. I don\u2019t wanna get into my sex life. A kiss means something to me.\u201d\n\nWhen the pre-chorus is repeated, Mitski changes the kiss she craves from an \u2018honest\u2019 kiss to a \u2018movie\u2019 kiss, possibly highlighting how deep her loneliness has developed throughout the song. She no longer craves an honest, loving, and intimate kiss, but will settle for what she can get to feel that intimacy. It may not be \u201creal\u201d, but her loneliness is so consuming that she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nA \u201cmovie kiss\u201d could also mean that the kiss would be dramatic in the ways that it isn\u2019t always in real life. In movies, kisses are always climactic, and that kind of raw impact is what Mitski might crave to distract from her loneliness. While talking to London in Stereo, she mentioned how vital movies were to this new album:\n\nA lot of this album is just about cinema, and the effect of watching a movie or being in a movie. Growing up a lot of my relationships were fantasies. I didn\u2019t have a chance to get to know people or build real relationships. I don\u2019t know what the draw of infatuation is, but I know that it helped me survive when I was younger."

            "plain": "\u201cMe and My Husband\u201d is the seventh track of Mitski\u2019s fifth studio album Be The Cowboy released in August 2018.\nLike earlier tracks on the album such as \u2018Nobody\u2019, \u2018Me and My Husband\u2019 explores the loneliness Mitski felt while writing the album, although this time she takes on the persona of a suburban housewife. As she explained to GQ:\n\nIf you\u2019re a suburban mom surrounded by family with a nice life you still feel alone. On tour, I\u2019m surrounded by people all the time but it\u2019s lonely.\n\nDespite the songs upbeat tone the lyrics portray a housewife stubbornly sticking by her husband even though she may not be happy. Mitski claims the song isn\u2019t personal and isn\u2019t meant to be reflection of her views on marriage or settling down as she told The Outline:\n\nI try to keep a sense of humor about all this stuff. I\u2019m not married, I don\u2019t have a husband, but I was just thinking about being a woman with a man in a long term relationship. I used a stereotype of the suburban, old-fashioned housewife to kind of accentuate my point."

As she explained to GQ:\n\nIf you\u2019re a suburban mom surrounded by family with a nice life you still feel alone. On tour, I\u2019m surrounded by people all the time but it\u2019s lonely.\n\nDespite the songs upbeat tone the lyrics portray a housewife stubbornly sticking by her husband even though she may not be happy. Mitski claims the song isn\u2019t personal and isn\u2019t meant to be reflection of her views on marriage or settling down as she told The Outline:\n\nI try to keep a sense of humor about all this stuff. I\u2019m not married, I don\u2019t have a husband, but I was just thinking about being a woman with a man in a long term relationship. I used a stereotype of the suburban, old-fashioned housewife to kind of accentuate my point."

It\u2019s reminiscent of a previous song on Be the Cowboy, \u201cLonesome Love\u201d as it describes how the characters self-worth is purely based on her partner.\n\n\u2018Cause nobody butters me up like you, and\nNobody fucks me like me\n\nShe is also portraying a stereotypically feminine woman in a world that doesn\u2019t always value women and therefore may be feeling disempowered by her place in the world. She only feels validated by her husband, the male presence in her life."

              "A furrowed brow usually comes with age, and it may, then, indicate a desire for a relationship that stands the test of time.\n\n\n\nA furrowed brow is also a facial expression usually expressing frustration or judgement. As Mitski takes on the role of a stereotypical housewife, her husband is likely a masculine stereotype as well and therefore cold or aggressive. Her character is desperate for affection from her husband but he simply stands in judgement. She told London In Stereo that the song was inspired by the relationships she saw in films as a child which often rely heavily on stereotypes:\n\nIt\u2019s a fantasy formed from Mitski\u2019s childhood, which she spent \u201cjust watching movies and assuming that\u2019s how love is, and wanting that.\u201d\n\nA furrowed brow describes a partner that is more angry or serious, which overall describes negative emotions that may exude from the partner. The fact that she is willing to bet all she has on even the negative parts of her partner explains the dependence that exists within the relationship. Although marriage and relationships require compromise and fights become inevitable, women have historically been forced to find a partner and stick with them through anything. Even just decades ago, divorce was seen as a really scandalous idea which was avoided in fear of judgment from other people."

              "Mitski discussing the song in an interview with The 405:\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that you decided to make it into a song though, considering you\u2019re not married\u2026\n\nI think a big part of me is retaliating against youth culture, because I\u2019m getting older, but I\u2019m in the entertainment business, where I\u2019m expected to be young forever and sing about going to the club and being infatuated with someone and having your first love. But I\u2019m 27, like\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve got some of those things covered, maybe not the club part but the infatuation part\u2026\n\nExactly! But I can\u2019t keep doing that and still being truthful, because the reality is I\u2019m an adult now, and I\u2019m getting older, and you get older you see a lot of sides of love, and you experience relationships that aren\u2019t just your first love. I think so much of music is so youth-oriented, when there are so many more stories to tell. A pop song doesn\u2019t just have to be about that young love, because there\u2019s so many more experiences that are worth singing about."

            "plain": "The \u201closing dogs\u201d or failed relationships that Mitski pursues. This represents a sort of unrequited love in which Mitski\u2019s feelings are not reciprocated with the same intensity.\nThe use of \u201cbaby\u201d in the song could allude to how she wants someone to care for and to be cared for in return.\n\nThe metaphor of \u2018betting on losing dogs\u2019 refers to Mitski getting into relationships that she knows are doomed, or with people who are too damaged to love her \u2013 she knows that it will inevitably end badly, but she consciously gets into a relationship regardless.\n\nShe\u2019s asking them to let her keep believing in the illusion that they are gonna work out or that they are gonna love her back one day.\n\nIt also alludes to the idea that she, herself, is a losing dog. She hopes that her lover will be there to comfort her when she is down, just as she does.\n\nAnticipating the theme of \u201cThursday Girl\u201d, in these lines, the narrator sings about her desire to feel the pain in defeat of rejection.\n\nShe longs for the intimacy and connection formed with her lover. An orgasm is known as a \u201clittle death\u201d (from the french term \u201cla petite mort\u201d).\n\nHer lover looks in her eyes, rather than Mitski looking in the eyes of the losing dogs. This reversal is interesting.\n\nAlso, the mention of orgasm could be a reference to Happy, perhaps contrasting the experience of being with a \u2018losing\u2019 lover with the experience of unsustainable happiness."

                  "plain": "The \u201closing dogs\u201d or failed relationships that Mitski pursues. This represents a sort of unrequited love in which Mitski\u2019s feelings are not reciprocated with the same intensity.\nThe use of \u201cbaby\u201d in the song could allude to how she wants someone to care for and to be cared for in return.\n\nThe metaphor of \u2018betting on losing dogs\u2019 refers to Mitski getting into relationships that she knows are doomed, or with people who are too damaged to love her \u2013 she knows that it will inevitably end badly, but she consciously gets into a relationship regardless.\n\nShe\u2019s asking them to let her keep believing in the illusion that they are gonna work out or that they are gonna love her back one day.\n\nIt also alludes to the idea that she, herself, is a losing dog. She hopes that her lover will be there to comfort her when she is down, just as she does.\n\nAnticipating the theme of \u201cThursday Girl\u201d, in these lines, the narrator sings about her desire to feel the pain in defeat of rejection.\n\nShe longs for the intimacy and connection formed with her lover. An orgasm is known as a \u201clittle death\u201d (from the french term \u201cla petite mort\u201d).\n\nHer lover looks in her eyes, rather than Mitski looking in the eyes of the losing dogs. This reversal is interesting.\n\nAlso, the mention of orgasm could be a reference to Happy, perhaps contrasting the experience of being with a \u2018losing\u2019 lover with the experience of unsustainable happiness."

Many people, including myself, believe that this song could be talking about unhealed trauma from a past relationship which was unhealthy. However, Mitski uses the word baby which means she probably still cares about her past lover. The pearl could be talking about the past relationship and the \u201cglow\u201d is all the good things about the relationship standing out to mitski. Mitski still calls the person \u201cbaby\u201d which is something that lovers call each other. This could show us that mitski thinks that the other persons not done anything wrong and she could still love them.\nIn a more recent song, The only heartbreaker, she talks about how during the relationship she felt like she was the only one making mistakes and in her eyes the other person was perfect"

It is difficult to let go of past trauma, and she apologizes to her lover for being distant and withdrawn due to her experiences. However, the bridge suggests that she is allowing her lover to help fill the hole, a positive juxtaposition from the rest of the song.\n\nAlternatively, the sense that the partner \u201cfilling a hole\" is not necessarily a good thing; the line may refer to the fact that she\u2019s using her partner to cope. They\u2019re filling up a space left behind by something else, and even trying their hardest it seems this isn\u2019t enough. She\u2019s pushing them away at the same time she claims to still want them. Acknowledging that they\u2019re growing weary of her evasiveness, but without doing anything to address the root of the issue. This withdrawal is causing their relationship to be strained and she can see it happening, yet her attention is still consumed by things that represent her trauma rather than anything that might help her recover from it."

You repeat self-destructive behaviours because it\u2019s what you know, it\u2019s what you feel you deserve and what you\u2019re comfortable with. If it\u2019s just your life then you can be as self-destructive as you want, but what makes it complicated is if you have someone else in your life who cares about you, if you\u2019re in a relationship, and you\u2019re supposed to be fine and you have someone asking about you and caring about you, but you just can\u2019t stop being unhappy, because being unhappy is what you want.

            "plain": "Liquid Smooth is the first song on Mitski\u2019s 2012 album, Lush. This song talks about beauty standards for young women. Lyrics like \u201cI\u2019m in my prime\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at my highest peak, I\u2019m ripe\u201d suggest that she is talking about how women in their early 20\u2019s are seen as more desirable.\n\nAt the end of the chorus, she says that she is \u201cabout to fall.\u201d This lyric and the general tone of the song suggest that she is worried about aging because she will no longer fit within the beauty standards."

Lyrics like \u201cI\u2019m in my prime\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at my highest peak, I\u2019m ripe\u201d suggest that she is talking about how women in their early 20\u2019s are seen as more desirable.\n\nAt the end of the chorus, she says that she is \u201cabout to fall.\u201d This lyric and the general tone of the song suggest that she is worried about aging because she will no longer fit within the beauty standards."

The song includes lyrics that explain how there was an attempt to make the relationship last, however with lacking support this led to its inevitable downfall. Mitski\u2019s melancholic vocals portray a tone to the listener, one that is filled with a despairing plea, an exhausted attempt to save their relationship one last time with the words, \u201cI want you\u201d."

The use of the two pet names \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201cdear\u201d show how, despite how bad the partner may be, the speaker still holds them dear to their heart. However, the final verse of this Pre-Chorus of \u201cI am done, dear\u201d demonstrates how the speaker is finally ready to accept that this person is not good for them ; how it is time for them to let go."

The song follows a similar theme to Liquid Smooth, detailing the overarching feeling of being \u201cin your prime\u201d but only dreading the fall yet to come, in which both physical and mental condition begin to decay due to both aging and settling into a so-called societal norm. It also details the feeling that one should\u2019ve succeeded earlier in life and it\u2019s now impossible to do so.\n\nMoving to a new city is done by some people to supposedly restart their life \u2013 by leaving everything and everyone they\u2019re accustomed to behind and starting from scratch in friends, work, and location. This can work for some, however restarting in a new does not always remove personal matters such as depression, anxiety, or grief."

The song follows a similar theme to Liquid Smooth, detailing the overarching feeling of being \u201cin your prime\u201d but only dreading the fall yet to come, in which both physical and mental condition begin to decay due to both aging and settling into a so-called societal norm. It also details the feeling that one should\u2019ve succeeded earlier in life and it\u2019s now impossible to do so.\n\nMoving to a new city is done by some people to supposedly restart their life \u2013 by leaving everything and everyone they\u2019re accustomed to behind and starting from scratch in friends, work, and location. This can work for some, however restarting in a new does not always remove personal matters such as depression, anxiety, or grief."

              "The second verse details two different ways in which Mitski believes a downfall will happen to her and why happiness and success may never happen, with the same structure as the first verse (two lines on one topic, two on another).\n\nThe first two involve how time itself is against her, and personality is given to the abstract form of time as it becomes frustrated that she\u2019s not reaching the perceived level of \u201csuccess\u201d that she could be in the first line, and tries to then literally pull her rather than hold her down in the second, as if she is stuck in the passage of time against her will.\n\nHowever, the third and fourth line change the subject that she believes is stopping her from being happy and successful to herself. The combination of starting to reach a point where her body should begin to degrade in the third and both her way of living and outlook on life in the fourth are both reasons she thinks are why she\u2019s not happy in life."

              "In the first verse, Mitski details multiple negative parts of herself that she\u2019s noticed. In the context of the song title, these could be considered reasons to move to a \u201cbrand new city\u201d.\n\nThe first two lines relate to depression and the symptoms it causes. The first could refer to memory loss, a symptom of depression that can occur either through treating or living with depression. The second is a double entendre of the heart: referring to the organ and a desire to destroy it due to depression, as the heart is a vital organ required to live, whilst also referring to the heart in terms of relationships \u2013 either a want for love or pain due to loneliness, or even both.\n\nThe second two lines refer more to the deterioration of the human body as it gets older \u2013 once the body is fully grown, it can only start deteriorating due to the fact it\u2019s no longer growing, hence my body is falling in pieces representing the degradation of the body and my blood is passing me by inferring the flow of time \u2013 Mitski may want to hang on to the current moment, however blood must keep moving around the body.\n\nFor context, Lush was released in 2012, when Mitski was 21. Whilst the human body usually doesn\u2019t decay until later in life, it\u2019s a common concern among young adults that they haven\u2019t made the most of the present when they think they should physically and mentally be able to, and that they\u2019ll only grow to regret wasting such time in later life. This is obviously not true, despite feeling like it is \u2013 success can come at any point in life."

              "This repeated group of lines has multiple simultaneous interpretations.\n\nIn one interpretation of Mitski as the caregiver, the protagonist\u2019s Honey, clearly someone important to her, has \u2018taken\u2019 something ie: a drug. The protagonist tries to care for them, and so says \u2018look at me,\u2019 out of concern and to reassure.\n\nHowever, if \u2018take\u2019 is interpreted as more like theft, ie: what did you take from me, the protagonist\u2019s \u2018honey\u2019 subsequently becomes an expression of  hurt or scorn. The protagonist\u2019s loved one will not look at them out of shame or to not acknowledge their guilt.\n\nThese double meanings are likely intentional, given Mitski\u2019s other works' themes of conflicting identity, such as conflicting expressions of internalised anger and expectations of female caregiving roles in relationships. This is also supported by the themes of unraveling identity throughout the lyrics."

By moving to a \u201cbrand new city\u201d she\u2019s accepting the fact that her life is slowing and this obsession is not healthy or helping her move (as shown in previous lines). That if being pretty is how she learnt to \u201clive\u201d, she\u2019ll just have to learn to \u201cdie\u201d."
