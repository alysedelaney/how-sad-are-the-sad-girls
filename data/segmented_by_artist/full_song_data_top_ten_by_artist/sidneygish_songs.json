            "plain": "This song tells a narrative- not always with a clear meaning, but dealing with themes of love, reciprocation, and growing up. Throughout the song, Gish seems to come to an important conclusion, and attempt to share it with others- but to the listener, this conclusion is not necessarily clear. Overall, this song forgoes traditional structure to create an ambiguous, poetic piece of music with clever wordplay and an intriguing message."

Throughout the song, Gish seems to come to an important conclusion, and attempt to share it with others- but to the listener, this conclusion is not necessarily clear. Overall, this song forgoes traditional structure to create an ambiguous, poetic piece of music with clever wordplay and an intriguing message."

It describes the self being pulled apart by the allure of the id\u2019s power and the super ego\u2019s wisdom, and how it\u2019s like a sickness upon our soul and source of constant suffering as it makes us lost on our path to knowing, and being known by others. But also the reason we can hold two contradictory truths simultaneously and the blessing of the free will to choose pleasure over pain and make friendships as an individual who is by nature, alone and divided."

            "plain": "\u201cImpostor Syndrome\u201d is about how Sidney Gish feels as if she isn\u2019t good enough and not worthy of her achievements. She is hyper-aware of herself and knows that she shouldn\u2019t feel so insecure, but she can\u2019t help herself with her imposter syndrome.\n\nHer insecurity and anxiety comes from the overwhelming rise of her music career. Gish has been highly acclaimed over the years with her previous releases including the bandcamp releases since 2015 and the 2016 full-length studio album Ed Buys Houses, getting opportunities to perform at many venues. But being only 20 years old studying at Northeastern University, juggling her music career wasn\u2019t so easy. She told how she experienced anxiety of becoming famous in the 2017 interview with Allston Pudding:\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that I tend to overcompensate for feeling weird, like, my panic response is to be weird as fuck. It used to be being quiet and it still is, but now there\u2019s, like, a threshold where I start being terrifying once I cross. I felt super weird about that for a long time, but [I realized people] just express their anxiety in different ways than me. They don\u2019t just think I\u2019m uncool\u2026 well, they probably do, but I\u2019m expressing it through being loud.\n\n\u201cImposter Syndrome\u201d highlights her trademark lyricism expressing her anxiety becoming an adult and feeling doubts in her accomplishments and anxiety of not having a full roadmap of her life with a sense of humor. The bubbly melody masks the dread of the expressions, but her falsetto voice in the chorus portrays her truer delivery of the lyrics."

              "\u201cFrankenstein\u201d refers to Victor Frankenstein from the eponymous 1818 novel by Mary Shelley. Frankenstein is the creator of the creature, commonly referred as \u201cthe monster,\u201d made with mishmash of body parts of human corpses. After feeling disgusted at himself for building a creature that became lonely and depressed as a result of being treated poorly by anyone it encountered, Frankenstein commits suicide. The novel\u2019s theme revolves around the imperfection in human pursuit of knowledge for the root of human life and purpose.\n\nSidney feels as if she had artificially built her personality and music that\u2019s a mishmash of traits from her favorite musicians and other influential people in her life. She thinks of herself as both the creator and the creation of Victor. Her \u201cbehavioral Frankenstein\u201d alludes to her having feelings akin to Victor\u2019s for building something disgustingly deformed he initially envisioned to be a perfect design of the source of human life. She had stitched together traits of people she admired and aspired to be, ending up insecure that she became unoriginal and imperfect.\n\nIn the 2017 interview with Boston Globe, she mentions drawing inspiration from \u201cmusicians like Vampire Weekend, Of Montreal, and Regina Spektor\u201d and adapting their idiosyncratic lyricism and innovative instrumentation to her own music. She was a member of choir in middle and high school, and she was part of the a cappella scene in college, where she also learned to beatbox. She additionally learned to play the piano, the ukulele, and the guitar.\n\nI\u2019ll get an idea for a melody and then lyrical ideas, and I have to put them together on my own. I wish I got into a state of flow where both are happening at the same time; that would be really cool, but that never happens. [\u2026] I really liked doing theater in middle school, because I got to pretend to be somebody else, and whenever I was playing a character, I was fine. But to do singer-songwriter stuff on stage didn\u2019t really come naturally.\n\nDespite the fact that all of her inspirations and skills contributed to her success in building her own style of music, Sidney described her process of writing her own songs and creating melodies as \u201cFrankensteining\u201d in the interview."

              "In this verse, Sidney introduces her self-perceived awkwardness by comparing herself to two awkward beings. If you\u2019ve ever seen an old lady try to use social media, you\u2019ll notice that they aren\u2019t quite as tech savvy as younger people. On forums, older people often write very formally, and to the more digitally fluent ~youth~ it sounds pretty awkward. And then, of course, dogs are cute and great, but they don\u2019t exactly have human-like behavior or social skills. She also isn\u2019t very happy about all this, which is why she starts her thought with \u201cunfortunately\u201d.\n\nBut we can get more psychological here, and with a song called Impostor Syndrome, why wouldn\u2019t we?\n\nWhen Sidney says \u201cI am / My own dog, my own fur companion / My own old lady\u2026\u201d she creates a dichotomy of her self- basically meaning she separates herself into multiple parts in her mind. It normally wouldn\u2019t make sense for one thing to be the \u201cdog\u201d of itself, but because of this separation, she is saying that one aspect of herself is the \u201cdog\u201d of another aspect of herself. The more conscious part, the owner of the metaphorical dog and old lady, seems to be Sid\u2019s ego, the organized and rational part of the self in Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic theory. The old lady and the dog seem to represent Sid\u2019s id, which is the instinctual and uncoordinated counterpart to the ego."

In Northeastern University, students are required to work co-ops or semester-long internships in order to graduate. Sidney chose to spend the time to work at professional musical labels.\n\nShe originally planned to go into sociology or songwriting for her major, but on the Common Application for Northeastern, she applied as a music business major. She talked about how she wanted to focus on business than strict conservatory training in the 2017 interview article by The Huntington News. She said:\n\nI was going to major in songwriting, but then I\u2019d just be going around trying to get approval from all of my songwriting professors. I\u2019d probably still be doing that if I had gone to Berklee [College of Music].\n\nAt the time she wrote and released No Dogs Allowed, she was still a student while being a successful musician, managing her own music career by self-releasing her albums. She took no break to \u201cwaste time on any shit,\u201d and didn\u2019t want to be bothered by other people while studying in university and managing her music career that would slow her down. Calling herself a \u201cbusinessman\u201d rather than a \u201cbusinesswoman,\u201d \u201cbusinessperson,\u201d or \u201cmusician,\u201d she is depicting herself in the stereotypical caricature of a Wall Street office worker who calls themselves \u201cself-made man.\u201d"

              "Sidney repeats the same line from the earlier chorus. However, the line weighs a heavier meaning as the song progresses.\n\nShe uses the word \u201cwasted\u201d as a way to express how she feels \u201cwashed up already\u201d at the age of 20. Her bandcamp music career had taken off since 2015 with songs she had written since 2011, at which she was 14 years old. Her 2016 debut full-length studio album Ed Buys Houses brought her up to a great deal of fame that prompted her to tour for an entire year taking a break from college. Still, being 20 years old in 2017 when she released No Dogs Allowed, juggling her music career with being in college was no cakewalk. She was hanging out with different groups of people, one from her college and the other from the music industry. At such age when she\u2019s still trying to grasp a sense of her own identity, she feels as if she\u2019s outgrown her youth. But at the same time, she\u2019d just like to take a break and be \u201chigh,\u201d as in stoned smoking weed.\n\nIn this chorus, \u201cI\u2019m high\u201d has a double meaning in contrast to the first chorus. She is alluding to her \u201chigh\u201d success in her music career. While she tells how dreadful the business aspect of being in the music industry is to be in, she tries to laugh it off by sounding sarcastic when she says she\u2019s \u201cwasted\u201d in regards to her life\u2019s progress.\n\nThe multitude of conflicting feelings makes her overwhelmed, but she tries to keep on moving on to the next thing. The way she repeats this line shows her growth."

The title \u201cI Eat Salads Now\u201d holds different interpretations, one of which is that she now smokes \u201cgreen,\u201d slang for marijuana. Sidney is growing out of her earlier teenage years when she was trying to find her identity, and now knows what she wants, finding her own people instead of drinking to a stupor trying to socialize.\n\nFollowed by this line\u2019s laughed off tone, she later uses the word \u201cwasted\u201d again in a different meaning in the same repeated line."

'Cause I want it all\nAnd I'd really rather step back, but my back's against the wall\nWhat if I'm too nice?\nIt\u2019s a punch in the face to be so over polite\nWhat do you want from me tonight?\nAnd my voice is too high\nAnd it matches my head and I look like I wanna die\nWhat do you want from me tonight?\n\n'Cause I'm invited, but I'm terrifying too\nAnd I'll sit here for a million years just staring across the room\nBut what do you want? 'Cause I want it all\nAnd I'd really rather step back, but my back's against the wall\n\nAnd I'm born too tall to contort my spine into a ball\nAnd I wanna disappear but I\u2019m not adequately small\nI'm invited but I'm terrifying too\nAnd I'll sit here for a million years just staring across the room\nBut what do you want?

Up to you\nWhat's worth watching\nOnce enrolled in filming school\n[Verse 1]\nBut everybody's got their litmus test\nWhat's worth watching, what is best\nAnd it's no different, ev\u0435n once you're ther\u0435\n\n[Refrain]\nOnce I'm there\nDon't enroll (I won't enroll)\nFilming school\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got my litmus test\nBack and it said, \"You're the best\"\nBack and it said I'm the best\n'Cause we're worth watching\nWe're enrolled in filming school\nWe walked around that blank museum\nAnd cried our tears and held our hands\nAnd we were each other's best friends\nAnd we went down to town and said a million things are happening\nThat are so smart and beautiful (Worth watching)\nYes, you passed my litmus test\nYes, I swear that you're the best\n(No you're the best! No you're the best! No you're the best!)\n(You're worth watching, you're worth watching)\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nHere\nOnce I'm there\nDon't enroll (I won't enroll)\nFilming school\n\n[Chorus]\nOn occasion there will be plot points\nOn occasion there'll be art (Oh my)\nOn occasion there'll be nothing left at all\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBut that's alright for me and you\nAnd me and you\nAnd me and you\nAnd me and you\nAnd me and you\nAnd me and you\nAnd me and you\n(Me and you)\n\n[Chorus]\nOn occasion there will be plot points\nOn occasion there'll be art (Oh my)\nOn occasion there'll be long pretentious things\nTo tell apart from real content (How?)\n'Cause in the best of times and worst of times\nThat line is up to you\nIt's up to who?
