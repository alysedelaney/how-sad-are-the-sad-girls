            "plain": "\u201c1950,\u201d released on February 3, 2018, is King Princess\u2019s debut song. On the day of the song, and visual, release, KP spoke to The Line Of Best Fit about the inspiration of the track:\n\nQueer love was only able to exist privately for a long time, expressed in society through coded art forms. I wrote this song as a story of unrequited love in my own life, doing my best to acknowledge and pay homage to that part of history.\n\nKP has also specifically cited the novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith as an inspiration behind the song.\n\nI was reading a lot of gay literature and there was one book, The Price of Salt that really stuck with me because it\u2019s just a beautiful story, and I think what I loved about it was it took place in the \u201850s and the way that queer people were allowed to be public was so censored it and it was all about body language and this kind of icy interaction because you had to hide yourself and so I was interested in the parallel between the metaphor of 1950 being how queer love looks in public and how it\u2019s very similar to having a very cold relationship.\n\nThis song doesn\u2019t just serve as King Princess\u2019s debut. This is also the first song to be released by Mark Ronson\u2019s record label, Zelig Records, an imprint of Columbia Records."

                  "plain": "\u201c1950,\u201d released on February 3, 2018, is King Princess\u2019s debut song. On the day of the song, and visual, release, KP spoke to The Line Of Best Fit about the inspiration of the track:\n\nQueer love was only able to exist privately for a long time, expressed in society through coded art forms. I wrote this song as a story of unrequited love in my own life, doing my best to acknowledge and pay homage to that part of history.\n\nKP has also specifically cited the novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith as an inspiration behind the song.\n\nI was reading a lot of gay literature and there was one book, The Price of Salt that really stuck with me because it\u2019s just a beautiful story, and I think what I loved about it was it took place in the \u201850s and the way that queer people were allowed to be public was so censored it and it was all about body language and this kind of icy interaction because you had to hide yourself and so I was interested in the parallel between the metaphor of 1950 being how queer love looks in public and how it\u2019s very similar to having a very cold relationship.\n\nThis song doesn\u2019t just serve as King Princess\u2019s debut. This is also the first song to be released by Mark Ronson\u2019s record label, Zelig Records, an imprint of Columbia Records."

              "\u201cStone\u201c is a (historically) lesbian identity (and now expanded to other identities) that refers to a sexual partner who prefers to give sexual pleasure physically but not receive it. The classic book Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg explores this identity and is well known within the queer community. There are nuances to this dynamic but based on the exploration of 1950s butch/femme dynamics in this song it seems like this is a pretty overt callout to a stone butch."

He\u2019s like, \u201cDude Fuck yeah.\u201d Then  we were like the melodies are done, let\u2019s just get the second verse and let\u2019s get the chorus lyrics in. It really started verse one, chorus, and then we wrote verse two and the bridge obviously. It changed very little from the demo also. The song was recorded almost two years ago, and it really has stayed almost the same. Which makes me super happy because it\u2019s my production. I worked with my two very good friends on it.\n\n\u201cI hope that you\u2019re happy with me in your life\nI hope that you won\u2019t slip away\"\u2014that\u2019s sad. That\u2019s a sad lyric. The song is about love and fear and the way you present yourself in relationships. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the lyrics. \"Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?\u201d And talking about someone not kissing you until you least expect it, it\u2019s these moments of uncertainty that we all feel when we\u2019re in love. I think that that lyric is just the summation of all of those feelings. \u201cAre you gonna fucking leave me? Just want a heads up would be great ya know.\u201d\n\nI love that its so matter of fact. When I listen back to it the bridge, it\u2019s always like \u201cAwe.\u201d It\u2019s like a moment of sad reflection."

I think I wanted to emulate these male music figures that I had that were able to just talk about the women that they wanted to be with\n\nKing Princess' music is meant to normalize being LGBTQ+ by delivering her lyrics nonchalantly, as if she is just a man singing about a woman.

            "plain": "The first single from King Princess since her critically acclaimed Make my Bed EP, \u201cPussy is God\u201d unabashedly celebrates gay love (the song was co-written with actress Amandla Stenberg, Straus' girlfriend) through the lens of religious imagery.\n\nIn an interview  with Radio NZ KP talked about the background of the song:\n\nIt\u2019s simply not allowed to be played on many radio stations. Because you can\u2019t say \u2018pussy\u2019\u2026 but our president can in a shitty way. So that\u2019s really fun about the U.S.\nYou can\u2019t say pussy but you can talk about abusing women and be a politician.\nBut my gay ass can\u2019t say pussy on the radio. That\u2019s crazy to me.\nWhen I wrote it I wasn\u2019t thinking about the political implications of it.\nI think part of my experience is I feel like I\u2019ve been gay for a really long time. So when I write I feel like I write music first\u2026 I think about it from a musical standpoint before I think about it from a sexual or political standpoint.\nAs our world is unfolding right now and we have a lot of shit going on I feel proud to be a part of a piece of art that is kind and loving towards women, while also appreciating the anatomy that has been marginalised through all of our history."

Because you can\u2019t say \u2018pussy\u2019\u2026 but our president can in a shitty way. So that\u2019s really fun about the U.S.\nYou can\u2019t say pussy but you can talk about abusing women and be a politician.\nBut my gay ass can\u2019t say pussy on the radio. That\u2019s crazy to me.\nWhen I wrote it I wasn\u2019t thinking about the political implications of it.\nI think part of my experience is I feel like I\u2019ve been gay for a really long time. So when I write I feel like I write music first\u2026 I think about it from a musical standpoint before I think about it from a sexual or political standpoint.\nAs our world is unfolding right now and we have a lot of shit going on I feel proud to be a part of a piece of art that is kind and loving towards women, while also appreciating the anatomy that has been marginalised through all of our history."

But I think if there\u2019s a space for religion and sexuality to intersect, there can be some comedy about it because there is something extremely fucked up and fun about being the antithesis of a belief system. Gay people always have existed in the religious community, but never in a way that\u2019s respectful.\n\nShe also included religious allusions in \u201c1950\u201d and \u201cHoly.\u201d"

This song is another appreciation of the two and further explores the powerful link between them.\n\nThe completely shameless and direct delivery of \u2018Pussy is God\u2019 makes this a pretty iconic song \u2013 there\u2019s no beating about the bush when it comes to talking about her love of women and it\u2019s extremely refreshing in a society where until recently the LGBTQ+ community was completely incapable of existing and loving visibly."
