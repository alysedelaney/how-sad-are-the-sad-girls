        "lyrics": "The Hitchhiker- REVISED DRAFT LyricsThe twelve o\u2019clock sun was beating down on the orange sand next to I-40 just outside of Needles, California.  About two hours ago, he could feel sweat trickle down his tan back; now it was dripping down his forehead leaving little dark brown circles on the orange sand as droplets of sweat fell from his chin and nose.  A seldom breeze would blow tumbleweed across the road for some brief entertainment as he sat on his backpack praying for a car to become visible in the distance.  He was hot and tired of waiting, and he was soon going to be dehydrated if he didn\u2019t get lucky before the sun set.\n\n\tHours continued to pass, and he barely sipped on his eighth bottle of water.  Not once did he think it would take eight bottles of water before he was picked up, he didn\u2019t think it was possible.  He slowly began drifting off into a place between sleep and lack of consciousness when he heard the slightest sound of a rumbling engine off to the east.  His brain was so alert but his body couldn\u2019t quite keep up.  The rumble gradually became closer and closer; his brain was racing one hundred miles per hour, trying to get his body to be at least half as alert as his mind.  As the rumble became clear enough to recognize it was a sports car and not a semi-truck or a motorcycle, his eyes opened, his head lifted from his knees, and his arms began waving in the air.  The rumble slows as it becomes even clearer, but he loses consciousness, tips off of his backpack and falls to the ground in the fetal position before the car reaches his campsite on the side of the road.\n\n\t\u201cSir, are you okay? You look really sick. How long have you been out here?\u201d a woman in her mid-thirties asks, to receive no response.\n\n\tThe young woman observes his tan skin, dark brown hair, stocky body type, then returns to her car for a bottle of Dr. Pepper she had bought to help her sorrows; she had been layed off from her company earlier in the day.  At this point, she put her sorrows aside and returns to the man.  She squats down next to him, turns his head enough to let the Dr. Pepper drip into his mouth.\n\n\t\u201cCome on, sir. You\u2019ve got to get some fluid in you. Open your eyes,\u201d she coaxes as she pats his back to encourage a response.\n\nNothing.\nShe waits patiently, continuing to talk and drip Dr. Pepper into his mouth, having no idea what his situation was.  She caught a glimpse of his backpack laying on the other side of him and stepped around him to look inside.  She found a dead cell phone in the side pocket, and seven empty water bottles, a book titled \u201cCarsick,\u201d a keychain with a compass attached, and a scrap of paper with Oak Island, SC scribbled on it in a blue faded ink.  She starred at the piece of paper, thinking about the fact that they were in California.  As she began to zip up the backpack, the man\u2019s leg twitched. Then he coughed.  She stood above him, shielding his eyes from the setting sun, and asking him to open his eyes.  His eyes opened.\n\nThe blonde woman who had had such a pitiful day after loosing her job squatted down next to the man with a huge sense of relief.  She smiled for the first time since the meeting she attended at eleven o\u2019clock that morning.\n\n\u201cSir, I was driving down the interstate and saw you tip over off of your backpack.  I couldn\u2019t help but stop and see if you were okay. What are you doing out here is this blazing sun?\u201d the woman asks.\n\nThe man sits up, squinting into the sun.  \u201cWho are you?\u201d he grunts through his dry throat.\n\n\u201cMy name is Natalie.  I was passing by on my way home.  I am a Registered Nurse, so I felt obligated to stop and check out your situation, especially when I saw you fall over unconscious\u201d she replied matter-of-factly.\n\nHe begins to realize the significance of who is standing in front of him, and his memory reminds him how much he prayed for a car to come down that highway.  Now a car has come.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what happened. I was just sitting out here, waiting for a car to come down the road.  Well, actually hoping a car would come down the road before sun set.  I ran out of water earlier this morning and I knew I wouldn\u2019t make it much longer,\u201d he confessed to the woman.\n\nThe woman looked at him, trying to determine his intentions, why he was out here waiting for a car, where he was trying to go. She had so many questions.\n\n\u201cDo you feel okay? Should I take you to a hospital? There\u2019s not a bit of cell service out here for me to call someone,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, no. I really don\u2019t need to go to a hospital.  I just got a little too hot out in the sun this afternoon.  I feel great now,\u201d he quickly replies.  The hospital is not the destination he was trying to reach.\n\n\u201cAre you trying to get somewhere?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cWell, actually yes. I am.  I\u2019m trying to get to South Carolina.  Oak Island to be exact.  Where are you headed? That direction?\u201d the man asks curiously as he starts to come to and get all of his senses back in working order.\n\nThe woman looks around, taking in the California scenery and lets the idea of traveling to South Carolina, by obviously hitchhiking, sink in. The she recalls the scribbled piece of paper she found in his backpack. She chuckles a little bit to herself.\n\u201cI actually came from the east, heading west towards home,\u201d she answers.  \u201cA home I\u2019m probably going to have to put on the market tomorrow,\u201d she continues to mumble under her breath in pity.\n\nAll of a sudden, Natalie was overwhelmed in her self-pity over the loss of her job and now she had used her Dr. Pepper to bring this stranger back to his senses on the side of I-40 in the middle of nowhere.  She is a middle class green-eyed blonde who had had multiple losses throughout her early life, no luck in the dating world, and lives in a small house with her fish, Bubbles, and had given up her RN position at a small hospital to travel around the country as a drug representative for a pharmaceutical company.\n\n\u201cHey, what do you say you take me somewhere down the road and then I\u2019ll hop in with someone else tomorrow,\u201d the man piped up.  \u201cI will admit hitchhiking wasn\u2019t one of my best ideas, but I\u2019ll take anything I can get, and honestly I\u2019m not too scared to get in your car,\u201d he smirks a little as he finishes his sentence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heading in the opposite direction you are trying to go.  I\u2019ve got to get home to,\u201d her voice drifts off.  She realizes she doesn\u2019t have any reason to get home.  This man is her biggest obligation right now.\n\n\u201cWell I guess I don\u2019t have work tomorrow, so I really don\u2019t have any reason to get home.  Yeah, let\u2019s get your stuff in the trunk and I have a towel you can sit on, not to be picky about my leather seats or anything,\u201d Natalie chuckles as she sees the absurd look come across the man\u2019s voice. \u201cWait, first. I don\u2019t even know your name,\u201d Natalie states.\n\n\u201cColby.  My name is Colby. I\u2019m not dangerous or scary. I don\u2019t have any weapons, or bad intentions.  I\u2019m just trying to get to South Carolina, and I will appreciate however far you want to take me,\u201d he replies, with a surprising amount of kindness in his voice.\n\nNatalie walks to her car, and Colby follows with his musty backpack.  He lays the towel across the front passenger seat of Natalie\u2019s car before sitting down.\n\nNatalie begins to drive.\n\n\u201cWe can drive until we get tired of listening to each other talk,\u201d Natalie said, with a little bit of sarcasm in her voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I have a credit card for gas money,\u201d Colby laughed.  \u201cBecause if that\u2019s the case then I will never stop talking.\u201d\n\nNatalie laughed, kind of forgetting about the horrible day she had had, and the mess her life had very quickly become.\n\n\u201cSo you said you have nothing to go home to,\u201d Colby leads into a conversation.  Natalie was a pretty lady, nice car, and obviously a kind heart to stop on the side of I-40 for a dirty looking man.  He couldn\u2019t imagine she didn\u2019t have anything to go home to.\n\n\u201cWell I have a fish named Bubbles,\u201d Natalie laughed.  \u201cI live by myself in a little white one bedroom house.  My parents were killed in a car accident when I was eight years old, so I grew up with my aunt and uncle.  Once I graduated high school, I was pretty much on my own.  I haven\u2019t had much luck dating either, and my life wasn\u2019t anything other than alone, so I decided to change my job and travel a little bit to see where I ended up.  And, well, here I am. Helping a hitchhiker across California.\u201d\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Colby said sympathetically.  I\u2019m really surprised you haven\u2019t had much luck with dating though,\u201d Colby spits out before really thinking what he was saying.\n\n\u201cYeah, well and I got layed off this morning, actually, so now I\u2019m going to have to sell my little house,\u201d Natalie finished.  Her emotion dropped, her face immediately showed sadness.\n\nColby felt kind of awkward.  He didn\u2019t know this lady. How was he supposed to feel such emotion towards her?  He looked out the window.  The cacti among the desert ground were passing quickly in the pinkish-orange horizon of the setting sun. He wondered if Natalie was going to drive through the night.  He saw a sign that read: Flagstaff 202 miles.  He figured he would hope for the best, and not ask.  She seemed like the type of lady that would kick him out when she was ready to turn around.\n\n\u201cSo, enough about me,\u201d Natalie jumped to break the silence.  \u201cWhat about you? What in the world is taking you to South Carolina?\u201d she asked.\n\nColby looked in her direction, his mind racing, wondering if he should tell her what he was doing, why he was depending on other people to help him travel across the country.  He decided she was kind-hearted, and the worst she could do was laugh.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Colby hesitated.  \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest, and brace myself for your response,\u201d he said.\n\nNatalie adjusted her hands on the steering wheel as she glanced over her right shoulder at him, almost seeming nervous.\n\n\u201cSo my life wasn\u2019t going anywhere, I hated my job. I worked downtown San Francisco at a coffee mill.  I don\u2019t have the greatest relationship with my family, so I figured at 27 years old I needed to figure something out, so I went and saw a psychic,\u201d Colby told her.\nNatalie chuckled a little and the sound of the word psychic.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m sure it sounds ridiculous, and it is kind of seeming like it might be, but I felt like I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired in San Francisco.  I sold my house, my cat, and my car,\u201d Colby continued.  He rubbed his palms down the tops of his thighs to try and ignore the sweat that was developing.\n\n\u201cThat makes sense of the hitchhiking,\u201d she laughed.  \u201cSo what? The psychic told you to try again in South Carolina?\u201d  Natalie asked.\n\n\u201cUm, well, I guess, yeah. That\u2019s what she said,\u201d Colby stuttered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that is very comical.  I have always heard about people visiting a psychic, but I have never met anyone who has done it, let alone anyone who listened to one of those crazy people,\u201d Natalie laughed.\n\nColby sat in thought for a minute, wondering if he was really doing something stupid, if South Carolina didn\u2019t have what the psychic had told him.\n\n\u201cI know this just makes it sound even worse, but she told me my soul mate is in Oak Island,\u201d Colby said, shyly.\n\n\u201cYour soul mate, huh? That sure is interesting,\u201d Natalie replied.  She began thinking about how great it would be to hear she had a soul mate somewhere, given, hearing that from a psychic is a little crazy.  She hadn\u2019t ever met a man she could stand living with for more than a month.\n\nThe two sat in silence for a few minutes.  Colby looked out the window to the interstate, recognizing some of the landmarks of Phoenix.\n\n\u201cSo, um. How are you doing on gas?\u201d Colby asked.\n\n\u201cThis baby gets some pretty good gas mileage,\u201d Natalie said as she pat the steering wheel.  \u201cWe\u2019ve only used about a quarter of a tank.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Wow, that\u2019s impressive,\u201d Colby replied. \u201cI was used to my truck, having to get gas every few hours.\u201d\n\nHe looks out the window again, recognizing in the darkness that they are through Phoenix and headed towards New Mexico now.  Time is passing so quickly, he realized.  He didn\u2019t even know this woman who stopped to check on him on the side of the interstate, and they have talked like they have known each other for months.  He wonders if she feels the same way.\n\n\u201cSo how far are you expecting me to take you?\u201d Natalie asks, breaking the silence yet again.\n\n\u201cAre you sick of hearing me talk yet?\u201d Colby asks with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly no,\u201d she answers. \u201cI find it pretty interesting that you are letting some lady who claims to be a psychic change your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s also pretty interesting that I\u2019m letting a strange woman drive me across the states,\u201d Colby returns the joke.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Natalie laughs.  \u201cBut really, how far are you expecting me to take you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I hear Kansas City is a pretty cool place.  If we make it that far, I can take you out somewhere to thank you for the lift,\u201d Colby suggests.\n\nNatalie adjusts in her seat, moves her hands from the top of the steering wheel, down to the bottom where her arms can rest in her lap.  \u201cKansas City, that\u2019s quite a ways.  It\u2019s probably like another 9 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a suggestion, don\u2019t feel obligated,\u201d Colby says.  I really appreciate you bringing me this far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you will be hungry in less than 9 hours, right?\u201d Natalie asks.  \u201cWe could stop here in the next few hours for a bite to eat and I will decide before then if I want to keep going or turn around.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that sounds good to me,\u201d Colby answers.  \u201cI mean, not to sounds too negative or anything, but what do you have to turn around for? What is back in California for you? I have a pretty good understanding of what it\u2019s like to live without family, and it\u2019s not all that great.\u201d\n\nNatalie looks at him.  In the time she looks away from the road, an animal runs up to the side of the interstate, Colby catches a glimpse of the large elk and is able to get an expression across his face for Natalie to jerk her head back to the road, see the animal but have no idea what it is, just enough logic to slam on the breaks and bring the sports car to a screeching halt on the interstate.  Before they can both take in a deep breath and relax their muscles enough to look outside for the animal, it had run back out into the darkness of the eastern New Mexico terrain.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Natalie stammered as she pushed herself back up into her seat and began to accelerate back to the 80 mile per hour speed limit.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t very smart for to look away from the road. Your comment just made me get lost in thought for a minute, I guess.\u201d\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we didn\u2019t hit any animals, and we didn\u2019t wreck.  But I might volunteer to find a different ride when we stop to eat,\u201d Colby slyly joked.\n\nNatalie gave him a glare without looking away from the road.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, I am getting pretty hungry since you mentioned it.  Let\u2019s stop in Texas.  We aren\u2019t too far from the border,\u201d Colby suggested.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight.  Our only option is probably going to be McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Natalie said with a slight whine in her voice.\n\n\u201cFine with me, I can always make room for a Big Mac,\u201d Colby said, patting his beyond empty stomach. \u201cI actually might need two to fill me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so gross,\u201d Natalie quickly replied.  \u201cDo you know how bad that disgusting stuff is for you? I can barely think of it as food,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh please. Everyone in this country eats it. Are you not American?\u201d Colby sarcastically asked.\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Natalie answered, slightly sassy this time.\n\nThe two looked out ahead and they continued to move steadily down the interstate, and at about the same time, they were able to see bright lights in the sky.\n\n\u201cSurely that\u2019s a town, right?\u201d Colby asked.\n\n\u201cI would assume so. I\u2019m not sure what else would be so lit up at this time of night,\u201d Natalie replied.\n\nAs they continued on, Colby read a sign for Amarillo.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Amarillo. Wow we have come a long way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIs that were you want to stop? I could get gas there too,\u201d she said. \u201cThen get back on the road back to California,\u201d she added quickly.\n\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s stop there. We can just grab something quick, and I\u2019ll try to find my next ride to continue out east,\u201d Colby said.\n\nNatalie didn\u2019t say anything.  As they approached the town, several fast food restaurants still had their open signs illuminated.\n\n\u201cHere to your left is a McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Colby said.\n\n\u201cOf all the places, McDonald\u2019s is where you want to go?\u201d she asked as she veered over to the left turning lane.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m buying, so I think you will be able to handle it for one meal.  A little bit of grease never hurt anyone,\u201d Colby laughed.\n\nNatalie let out a sigh as the light turned green and she turned left, and then right into the McDonald\u2019s parking lot.\n\n\u201cWould you like to eat inside?\u201d Colby asked. \u201cGet a little break from this car before you turn around and head home?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of your better ideas since I\u2019ve met you,\u201d Natalie joked.\n\nThe two squirm out of the car, as their joints are slow to straighten after sitting in the same position for so long.  As they walk up to the restaurant, the listing of hours on the door is halfway rubbed off, and the writing that was left was covered with dirt, along with the rest of the windows on the brick building.  When they walk inside, they discover that it isn\u2019t the cleanest, best-looking McDonald\u2019s they have ever experienced.  There are dead beetles and spiders on the floor, the rugs look like they haven\u2019t been vacuumed for months, and there are napkins all over a majority of the tables.\n\nNatalie looks at Colby, and he lets out a laugh.\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.  We will be here for like 20 minutes anyway.\u201d\n\nThey walked up to the counter.  The dark-skinned man taking their order was very polite for the setting of the restaurant.  Natalie orders a strawberry-banana smoothie and a grilled chicken sandwich with apples while Colby orders two Big Mac burgers and a large fry.\n\nNatalie reached for her water cup and walked over to pick a table.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a group of people walking up to the side door of the McDonald\u2019s.  They all had their hands in their pockets, which she found odd.\n\n\u201cColby, come over here,\u201d she called, trying to be quiet but loud enough for him to hear.\n\n\u201cHold on, our food is almost done,\u201d he answered as he turned back around.\n\n\u201cJust come here really quick,\u201d she persisted.\n\nColby didn\u2019t listen; he stood at the counter starring at their tray, patiently waiting for his large fry to complete their order.\n\nThe group of people outside approached the door, and once they stepped into the light, they had black and red ski masks on and all black clothing, all the way down to black shoes.  Natalie slid back in the booth, pressing her back firmly against the cold hard plastic material and her hands instinctively moved to her mouth. Several of the men still had their hands in their pockets. She sat in silence as she watched one of the men in the group step up behind Colby and pull his hands behind his back like he was being arrested.  At that instant, two male workers noticed the group, and Natalie picked up on the signal between the workers to call the police.  One of the workers walked up to the counter and couldn\u2019t even push any words out of his mouth.  One of the masked men pulled his hands out of his pockets and had two pistols, one in each hand.  He pointed them at the cashier, and said \u201cmoney\u201d is a grim, taunting voice.  The cashier froze.\n\n\u201cOpen the register,\u201d the voice from behind the mask said.\n\nColby turned to try and look at Natalie, who hadn\u2019t moved a centimeter from her position when she saw them walk in. The masked man holding his hands jerked him back.  The man with the pistols still had them pointed among the store workers.  The cashier had opened the drawer, and another masked man was emptying the cash into a red drawstring bag.\n\nColby tried to jerk away from the man holding his arms behind his back, as one of the masked men walked over to approach Natalie.  The man threw Colby to the ground and put a black shoe on his back, holding him down.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch her,\u201d he screamed from beneath the pressure of the man\u2019s foot.\n\n\u201cShut up, or a bullet will find your head,\u201d that same taunting voice echoed from behind a mask and through the silent building.\n\nNatalie scooted across the booth as the masked man tried to sit down and slide next to her.\n\n\u201cGet away from her, you son of a Bitch,\u201d Colby hollered from the ground.  \u201cLeave her alone. Do not touch her. I will kill you if you hurt\u2026\u201d Colby stammered as the pressure on his back increased.\nClick. BANG!\n\nNatalie let out an ear-piercing shriek as the masked man with the pistol cocked the gun and pulled the trigger with the barrel pointed at the ceiling.\n\nThe masked man sitting next to her tried to reach out and grab her, but Natalie had jumped from the booth over toward the door. She saw Colby struggling to get up and she caught his hand in hers as they both held steady on their feet to run out the door towards the car.  It didn\u2019t appear that any of the masked men chased them out of the store, but instinctively Colby ended up in the drivers seat of the car and spun the tires all the way out of the McDonald\u2019s parking lot.\n\nColby looked over at Natalie, tears rolling down her face.\n\n\u201cAre you okay? I am so sorry that happened,\u201d he said softly.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I ended up driving, but is it okay with you? At least until we get out of here?\u201d he asked.\n\nNatalie looked up at him, catching her breath.  She nodded.\n\nColby took a right hand turn back onto the interstate.\n\n\u201cThings like that, people like that, are why I had never ventured out of California.  Traveling for that job I had was the most exposure I had ever had, and I was always around business-class people,\u201d she stammered out in between sobs. \u201cPeople like that terrify me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI completely understand.  I am so sorry that happened. I feel awful, like it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Colby replied.\n\n\u201cNo, you had no control over those people, and that\u2019s why they are so scary.  They just do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whatever people they see,\u201d Natalie continued.\n\nColby moved his hand over to Natalie\u2019s thigh in a comforting way.  His hand seemed to fit perfectly over her leg, and no awkward feelings.\n\n\u201cWould you have any interest in getting some food at a drive-thru?\u201d  Colby asked.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry to seem like I\u2019m over that already, because I\u2019m not, but I am starving.\u201d\n\nNatalie smiled a small smile.  \u201cYes, we can get food. But can I request any place other than McDonald\u2019s? I\u2019m probably scarred now,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Colby replied as he gently squeezed her leg.\n\nAn exit sign approached with several fast food options listen on the sign.  Natalie commented about Wendy\u2019s, so Colby drove off the interstate to the Wendy\u2019s in northern Texas.  All of the letters on the sign were illuminated in the slowly rising sun.  The hours on the window were cleanly visible and all of the windows were clear and clean.  Colby and Natalie went through the drive-thu and ate their food in the car.\n\n\u201cWould you have any interest in getting a hotel for the night?\u201d Colby cautiously asked.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be creepy or anything, I know we hardly know each other but we have had a heck of a day.\u201d\n\nNatalie gave him an odd look.  \u201cIt\u2019s so weird how easily we can have conversation,\u201d she laughed.  \u201cI feel like I know more about you than the guy I dated four years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Colby asked sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m a sly guy.\u201d\n\nNatalie shook her head as a smile creped across her face.\n\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s stay somewhere,\u201d she finally answered.\n\nColby and Natalie found a nice looking Sleep Inn.  A large waterfall outside the front of the lobby gave a good feel, and the inside of the hotel was very clean and modern, with a very sweet front desk attendant.\n\n\tColby and Natalie walked down the long hallway with green and brown carpet, typical hotel carpet.  The smell of chlorine was strong from the pool and sauna at the end of the hallway.  Colby used the key card to open the door to a luxurious suite.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he stammered.  \u201cThis is a bit ridiculous.\u201d\n\nNatalie walked in and layed down on the bed.\n\n\u201cHey, the bed is so comfortable and that\u2019s all that matters tonight,\u201d she said.\n\nColby went to the bathroom to shower and clean up.  By the time he came back out, Natalie was fast asleep.  He pulled back the comforter and slid into the cold sheets, making sure Natalie had her space.  The last thing he wanted was for her to wake up and get frightened of him.\n\nNatalie rolled over in her sleep and nestled her head under Colby\u2019s shoulder.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t need to go all the way to Oak Island, South Carolina to find my soul mate,\u201d Colby thought out loud.\n\nNatalie, half asleep yet half awake, smiled too.Embed"

It\u2019s supposed to be like the Stax band. I knew what I wanted to do as far as having that Muscle Shoals, all-American kind of sound. But those guys took it to the next level. When I saw the horn arrangements my mind was blown, I got goosebumps. Oh my God, it\u2019s so beautiful and I never would have thought to do that. That\u2019s what\u2019s so wonderful about collaborating: your idea can explode and become something else."

Prass said about the recording of this track:\n\nWe did it on no money, working on spec, pulling in favours. It\u2019s supposed to be like the Stax band. I knew what I wanted to do as far as having that Muscle Shoals, all-American kind of sound. But those guys took it to the next level. When I saw the horn arrangements my mind was blown, I got goosebumps. Oh my God, it\u2019s so beautiful and I never would have thought to do that. That\u2019s what\u2019s so wonderful about collaborating: your idea can explode and become something else."
