        "lyrics": "Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas [Script] LyricsBLACK SCREEN\n\nA desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:\nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain\nOf being a man.\"\nDr. Johnson\n\nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe were somewhere around Barstow on\nthe edge of the desert when the\ndrugs began to take hold.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black\nscreen.\n\nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.\n\nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths\nup a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember saying something like:\n\"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe\nyou should drive...\"\n\nGONZO starts shaving.\n\n2.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSuddenly there was a terrible roar\nall around us and the sky was full\nof what looked like huge bats, all\nswooping and screeching and diving\naround the car...\n\nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The\nreflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\n\nGONZO\nMy heart!\n\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\n\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\n\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\n\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\n\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!  You're talking to a\nDoctor of Journalism!\n\n14.\n\n\nGONZO\n(laughing uncontrollably)\nWhat the fuck are we doing out here?\nSomebody call the police!  We need\nhelp!\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\n\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\n\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\n\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n\n15.\n\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\n\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\n\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\n\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\n\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\n\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\n\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\n\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\n\nDUKE\nYou whore!\n\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n\n16.\n\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\n\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\n\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\n\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\n\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\n\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\n\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\n\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\n\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\n\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP\nENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to\nqueue jump and failing.\n\n17.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was pouring sweat.  My blood is\ntoo thick for Nevada.  I've never\nbeen able to properly explain\nmyself in this climate.\n\nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes\nfixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nBe quiet, be calm... name, rank,\nand press affiliation, nothing\nelse...\n\nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the\ntension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING\nAROUND -- absolutely no success.\n\nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his\neyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET\nWHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE\nINEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n...ignore this terrible drug,\npretend it's not happening...\n\nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE\ncomes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND\nEXPLODES!\n\nDUKE\nHI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL\nDUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S\nFOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL\nWISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?\nI HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I\nREALIZE OF COURSE...\n\nAs DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.\nHe tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.\n\nDUKE\n... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE\nLIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.\nYES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND\nYOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S\nTHE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nDUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.\n\n18.\n\n\nRESERVATIONS CLERK\n(hands him an envelope)\nYour suite's not ready yet.  But\nthere's somebody looking for you.\n\nHer face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...\n\nDUKE\n(shouts)\nNO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING\nYET!\n\nThe FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.\nDEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm\nintensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.\n\nGONZO\nI can handle this.  This man has a\nbad heart, but I have plenty of\nmedicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.\nPrepare our suite at once.  We'll\nbe in the bar.\n\nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks\nback -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green\njowls and fangs.\n\nINT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY\n\nThe bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.\nDUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the\nwall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...\n\nGONZO\n(to the bartender)\nTwo Cuba Libres with beer and\nmescal on the side.\n(opens the envelope)\nWho's Lacerda, he's waiting for us\nin a room on the twelfth floor?\n\nDUKE\nLacerda?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI couldn't remember.  The name rang\na bell, but I couldn't concentrate.\nTerrible things were happening all\naround us...\n\nDUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY\nonto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.\n\n19.\n\n\nDUKE\nOrder some golf shoes.  Otherwise,\nwe'll never get out of this place\nalive.  It's impossible to walk in\nthis muck -- no footing at all...\n\nDUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.\n\nDUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED\ninto a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND\nGNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was right in the middle of a\nfucking reptile zoo.  And somebody\nwas giving booze to these goddamn\nthings!  It won't be long before\nthey tear us to shreds!\n\nGONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.\n\nGONZO\nIf you think we're in trouble now\nwait until you see what's happening\nin the elevators.\n\nGONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...\nas he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to\nkeep him in his line of vision.\n\nGONZO\nI just went upstairs to see this\nman Lacerda.  I told him I knew\nwhat he was up to...\n(GONZO rallies --\nturns fierce)\nHe says he's a photographer!  But\nwhen I mentioned Savage Henry he\nfreaked!  He knows we're onto him!\n\nDUKE\nBut what about our room?  And the\ngolf shoes?\n\nA GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at\nthem, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\n(grabbing GONZO\ntrying to hold him still)\nHoly shit!  Look at that bunch over\nthere!  They've spotted us!\n\n20.\n\n\nCut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing\nnext to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.\nGONZO is sitting in his original position.\n\nGONZO\n(downs his drink --\ngets up)\nThat's the press table.  Where you\nhave to sign in for our credentials.\nShit, let's get it over with.  You\nhandle that, and I'll check on the\nroom.\n\nDUKE\nNo, no.  Don't leave me!\n\nBlack screen.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK\n\nA TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,\nprotesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous\nBELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.

You scared the shit out\nof those people!  They were ready\nto call the cops.  Hell, the only\nreason they gave us press passes\nwas to get you out of there...\n\nA knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.\n\nDUKE\nOh my God!  Who's that?!\n\nGONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to\nLACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares\nat a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep\nsuspicion.\n\nLACERDA\nDuke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.\nGot your press passes?  Good, good.\nToo bad you missed the bikes\nchecking in.  My, what a sight!\n\nDUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.\n\n22.\n\n\nLooking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the\nBOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.\n\nDUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,\nfilthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --\ntalking a foreign language.\n\nLACERDA\nHusquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.\nMaicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.\nCouple of Triumphs, here and there\na CZ.  All very fast.  What a race\nit's gonna be.\n\nDUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is\nnow just a keen photographer.L\n\nLACERDA\nWell, we start at dawn.  Get a good\nnight's sleep.  I know I will.\n\nAnd with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.\n\nDUKE\n(weakly)\nThat's good...\n\nGONZO\nI think he's lying to us.  I could\nsee it in his eyes.\n\nDUKE\n(even weaker)\nThey'll probably have a big net for\nus when we show up.\n\nDUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...\n\nGONZO\nTurn that shit off!\n\nGONZO kills the TV.\n\nBlack screen.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever lose sight of the primary\nresponsibility.

I need help!\n\n46.\n\n\nDUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.\n\nDUKE\nShit, he's killing himself!\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nDUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio\nwith the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its\nmounts.\n\nGONZO\n(snarling)\nI want that fucking radio!\n\nDUKE GRABS THE RADIO.\n\nDUKE\nDon't touch it!  Get back in that\ntub!\n\nGONZO\nBack the tape up.  I need it again!\nLet it roll!  Just as high as the\nfucker can go!  And when it comes\nto that fantastic note where the\nrabbit bites its own head off, I\nwant you to THROW THAT FUCKING\nRADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!\n\nDUKE stares down at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  It would blast you through\nthe wall -- stone dead in ten\nseconds and they'd make me explain\nit!\n\nGONZO\nBULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.\n\nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.\n\nDUKE\nJesus.\n\nGONZO\nDo it!  I want to get HIGHER!\n\nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough.\n\n47.\n\n\nDUKE\nOkay.  You're right.  This is\nprobably the only solution.\n(holds the PLUGGED IN\nTAPE/RADIO over the tub)\nLet me make sure I have it all\nlined up.  You want me to throw\nthis thing into the tub when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks.  Is that it?\n\nGONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.\n\nGONZO\nFuck yes.  I was beginning to think\nI was going to have to go out and\nget one of the goddamn maids to do\nit.\n\nDUKE\nAre you ready?\n\nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS\nAND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.\n\nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a\ngood two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.\n\nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A\nTIDAL WAVE.\n\nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF\nTHE BATHROOM.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE slumps onto the sofa.\n\nSILENCE.\n\nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE\nWAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at\nDUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\n\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\n\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n\n48.\n\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\n\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\n\nGONZO\nThe cops?\n\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\n\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\n\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\n\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\n\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\n\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n\n49.\n\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\n\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\n\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\n\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\n\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\n\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\n\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\n\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n\n50.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n\n51.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\n\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\n\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\n\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\n\nQUICK CUT TO:\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\n\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican\nDay of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.\n\nGONZO\nWho?  You sound a little paranoid.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastard!  I need a lawyer\nimmediately!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you doing in Baker?\nDidn't you get my telegram?\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWhat?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in\ntrouble.

GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nYou're supposed to be in Vegas.  We\nhave a suite at the Flamingo.  I\nwas just about to leave for the\nairport.\n\nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\n\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.  This is how the world works.\n\nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nAll energy flows according to the\nwhims of the Great Magnet.\n\nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert\ndirt.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat a fool I was to defy Him.\n\nThe IGUANA sits unfazed.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever cross the Great Magnet.  I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.

The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.

Call the\nmanager!  I'm tired of listening to\nthis dogshit!\n\nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.\n\nCLERK\n(solicitously)\nI'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you\na cab?\n\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n\n65.\n\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\n\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\n\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n\n81.\n\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\n\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\n\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\n\nDUKE\nLucy called.\n\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\n\nGONZO\nWhat?\n\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY\n\nA worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.\n\nCLERK\nMr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm\nsorry we were cut off a moment\nago...

What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\n\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\n\nDUKE\nMe?\n\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.  That\nphone message wasn't for me, was it?\n\nA look of stunned realization from DUKE...\n\nINT.

He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.

She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.

He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.

I was\nsure of it...\n\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\n\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\n\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\n\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\n\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.

Why\ndo you think we're here?\n\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.

I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\n\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\n\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.

Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\n\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\n\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\n\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\n\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n\n94.\n\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\n\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\n\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\n\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\n\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\n\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\n\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\n\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n...

SHE LOOKS UP WITH\nA VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...\n\nDUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS\nOFF.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO\nlooks wildly around.\n\nGONZO\nGoddamnit!  We're lost!  What are\nwe doing out here on this\ngodforsaken road?\n\nGONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO\nThe airport is over there!\n\nDUKE\nNever missed a plane yet.\n\nDUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the\nWHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,\nHE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight\nup, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER\nA FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He\nthrows a worried look at DUKE.\n\nDUKE\nI'll drop you right next to the\nplane.\n\nThey SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET\nENGINE SCREAM.\n\nGONZO\nNo!  I can't get out!  They'll\ncrucify me.  I'll have to take the\nblame!\n\n106.\n\n\nDUKE\n(irritatedly)\nRidiculous!  Just say you were\nhitchhiking to the airport and I\npicked you up.  You never saw me\nbefore.  Shit, this town is full of\nwhite Cadillac convertibles.  I\nplan to go through there so fast\nthat nobody will even glimpse the\ngoddamn license plate.  You ready?\n\nGONZO\nWhy not?  But for Christ's sake,\njust do it fast!\n\nEXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO\nJUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.\n\nDUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.\n\nDUKE\nHey!\n\nGONZO stops -- turns.\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from those\nswine.  Remember, if you have any\ntrouble you can always send a\ntelegram to the Right People.\n\nGONZO\nYeah... Explaining my Position.\nSome asshole wrote a poem about\nthat once...\n\nGONZO pauses.\n\nGONZO\nProbably good advice, if you have\nshit for brains.\n\nGONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT\nTO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND\nLEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere he goes -- one of God's own\nprototypes -- a high powered mutant\nof some kind never even considered\nfor mass production.  Too weird to\nlive and too rare to die.\n\n107.\n\n\nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH\nTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT\n\nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find\nDUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\n\nDUKE\nWe are all wired into a survival\ntrip now.  No more of the speed\nthat fueled that 60's.  That was\nthe fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\nHe crashed around America selling\n\"consciousness expansion\" without\never giving a thought to the grim\nmeat-hook realities that were lying\nin wait for all the people who took\nhim seriously...\n\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly\nrises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT\nIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.\n\nDUKE\nAll those pathetically eager acid\nfreaks who thought they could buy\nPeace and Understanding for three\nbucks a hit.  But their loss and\nfailure is ours too.  What Leary\ntook down with him was the central\nillusion of a whole life-style that\nhe helped create...\n\nRISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30\nFEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\n\nDUKE\n... a generation of permanent\ncripples, failed seekers, who never\nunderstood the essential old-mystic\nfallacy of the Acid Culture: the\ndesperate assumption that somebody...\nor at least some force -- is\ntending the light at the end of the\ntunnel.\n\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n\n108.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE\nDRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out\nof the back seat as he takes a bump.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was only one road back to L.A.\nUS Interstate 15, just a flat-out\nhigh speed burn through Baker and\nBarstow and Berdoo, then on to the\nHollywood Freeway straight into\nfrantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,\njust another freak in the Freak\nKingdom.\n\nDUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING\nfacing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon\nsign that flashes beer.\n\nDUKE\nAhhh.  Wonderful.\n\nDUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.\n\nINT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY\n\nDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all\nabout the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON\nWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE\nRAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD\nMAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden\nbar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhat'll you have?\n\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\n\nDUKE\n(doubtfully)\nBallantine Ale...?\n\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND\nRELAXES.\n\nDUKE\nHard to find it served like this\nanymore.\n\nAs he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE\nAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n\n109.\n\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhere ya comin' from, young man?\n\nDUKE\nLas Vegas.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nA great town, that Vegas.  I bet\nyou had good luck there.  You're\nthe type.\n\nDUKE\nI know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(trustingly)\nThat's a fine combination.  You\ncan't lose.\n\nA LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS\nREALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...\nKISSES THE PROPRIETOR.\n\nDUKE\n(caught off guard... muttering)\nOh, my God!...\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(not understanding)\nThis is my granddaughter...\n\nDUKE\n(recovering)\nDon't worry...\n(leans forward in confidence)\n... and I'm actually the District\nAttorney from Ignoto County.\n(winks)\nJust another good American like\nyourself.\n\nA MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.\n\nWordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the\nback of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.\n\nWHO FEELS ASHAMED.\n\nDUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.\n\nEXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY\n\nA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.\nGets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...\n\n110.\n\n\nA state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.\n\nSomberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags\nstep off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...\n\nDUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the\ntrembling dash... DUKE catches it...\n\nONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...\n\nDUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --\nTEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.\n\nDUKE\nHOLY SHIT!!!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT\nTHE MARINES.\n\nDUKE\nGOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!\n\nDUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS\nIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE\nCONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nThe TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY\n\nDUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!\n\nDUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy heart was filled with joy.  I\nfelt like a monster reincarnation\nof Horatio Alger... a man on the\nmove... and just sick enough to be\ntotally confident.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nENDEmbed"

My peer for the night\nMy lady's rather tougher than your team's whole might\nSteam might rise if you meet low prides\nBut I reckon' that your tea takes a chi to the fight\nSee it is I with the beat's strong light\nAs a mean mother clubbin' get your free road right\nThese hoes lie about the king most times\nBut whatever I am better by my queen's [code side/coat site ?], motherfucker\n\nYeah, yotesquad\n\nAnd whichever path tooken\nYote drops cans of the granddad's [?]\nFor ya\n\nQueen's [code side/coat site ?], motherfucker\nQueen's [code side/coat site ?], motherfucker\n\n[Track 2: Braids]\n\n[Verse: Mr. Yote]\nI never can found this oasis\nSo we lounge inside [?] opening eyes\nTo see, this place ain't bad\nMight be dry but the skies ring glad\nTry, yeah yeah sigh\nMen won't [?] so we all five die\nBut actually [?] to the sutures\nOut of this beat we're seein' how I risen\n[?] you weren't the only [?]\n[?]\nAnd now I made home with these sticks and these clovers\nPetals of shade, purpa-purple [dishevelment ?]\n[level ?]my Axe [?]\n[?] my back\nFill up the tub with the bubbles I made\n[?] makin' a maze\n[?] my tub like it's made from the havens\n[?] my lapse\nThe angels sit on my [?] tip top\nDon't stop and I'll be washed\nI'll wash right out\nSo dig them fingers down till you reach my mental block\nGirl\nYou might also like(Oh)\n\nGod damn, I'm six too deep\n[?] your hands [] free\n[?] your breeze\nMaybe I [?] bully\nGirl run back\nKiss my ass\nDamn, I can't even think\nI guess you a rush to come back here to me\nHm, It's all but a dream so I guess\nI shall lay with the [?]\nIn me\n\nThese scorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nScorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nThese scorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nScorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nThese scorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nScorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nThese scorpions keep diggin' through my brain\nScorpions keep diggin' through my brain\n\n[Track 3: Flyknit Shoes]\n\n[Verse: Mr. Yote]\n(Oh yeah)\nI'll be in the club\nAnd I'll be doing dances\nSee I'll be chewing bugs\nAnd I'll be moving ransoms\nAll these pansies running frantic\nAs a pack of burning lanterns\nIs it simply sad romancing\n'Cause my levels rise to the touch\nIt's a rumble in the butt\nAn itchy pain that slowly cuts\nThrough all the centerfolds and duct tape\nThat dictate my knux\nThat's a fist face to crunch\nBurst [?] veins [?] suns\nSee my puppy on my [sizzler ?] [?] gets frisky in a rush\nNow chill boy\nIt's real, boy\nNow don't you press my skills boy\nI'm three years and going when you see me bite my thumbs\nIn these hides of metal gums\nSeem awfully fly when I put up\nIn the marigold, so very old\nOnce sunny collects dust\nAnd see frankly I've been busy in this shed with rusty nuts\nThat's a case of hallelujah in this final stage of boredom, boy\nSo rip the tidal waves or something if you seem to lack the jump\nI live life with no duration since I rise again from mud\nI brought bodies back from nothin' and then bake the skin and crust\nFinal fates seem awfully rubbish\nIf you take my word of tongue for it\n(Shhyeah)\n(Boy)\n\nI'll be in the club\nAnd I'll be doing- I'll be in the c-\nI'll be in the club\nAnd I'll be doing-\n\nSee, I'm a pretty easy rider\nBucket full of brains and a cup of red cider\nBugs in the belly, boy I love the brown spiders\nTub full of critters that's a tummy full of buyers\nShip full of dead men\nLivin' like it's neither\nLike to stick around boy to burn them bonfires\nBut see, maybe when I'm here today, I love ghost...\n\n[Track 4: Lakitu]\n\n[Verse: Mr. Yote]\nSome poopie \u00e0 la boobie did me duty\nThrow me in the hooptie with a bunch of dirty coochie\nI guess my camel lacks respect\nBut a couple laughs couldn't hurt you after sex\nCan you pass it, hit and sit back, you bitch\nThis is [?] hits the gas and watch [?]\nHere I am, in the heavenless [?]-city\n\nGrab ass with a couple old [?] shit\nSee the lodge in the desert as [lines are lit ?]\nBut regardless, it's all alright, the gorgeous crib\nBetween my bottom, [?] rather often\nAnd I guess the sweat dripping has you once [have ?] cut 'em\nRoam with the flocka, find home in the autumn\nBut Yote won't stop 'til I hit rock bottom\nYou got it, so go and skip bones for the night\nAs I trot in the chilly, ice cold, gettin' bites\nSee Jack Frost nippin' at my nose is in spite\nAnd in fact I have not a single no for the right path, fellow\nNow let us pluck out my cello\nNotes from the cello keep the drones out the meadow\nForgettin' saboteur our room's for a never little less\nWhere the tome is, where the wind blows gentle\nWhatever, yeah\nAnd Yote must drop in the desert forever\n\n[Verse: Yungeth Dre]\nAnd they're praisin' Yungeth Stein as he rises from the cellar\nCrackin' in my bones, smell of kush is in my sweater\nAnd I been there, that's alone that the time could barely measure\nIf they're headin' my direction and I'm taking out whoever\nAyy, no need for feeling pressure when I pass the [drome/drone ?]\nWe could find your type of pleasure\nNo I has to know\nI hear him talking 'bout a young 'un keep it rational\nBecause these dogs and them fuckers in the casserole\nAin't nothin' showin', game's in my thoughts drop emotion\nBut Yungeth won't stop if you keep the blunt glowing\nYou know this, the yotesquad leave him hopeless\nChanging the focus, only opened the space\nBetween the rulers of this desert I provoke to replace\nThey never notice how I'm moving through the slowest of days\nAnd my aroma never gonna get em close to the Dre\n\n[Track 5: GYAKUSOU]\n\n(Shhyeah)\n\n[Verse: Mr. Yote]\nTell me how does this smell?\nPound the hound what stays in the trail\nDown de de down deep down to the shell\nSee our old flag ready for the a traipse to his cell\nHey Sid, take a few [?] of the [?]\nMaybe down to [?] maybe [?] to the [?]\n[?]\n[?] and see if I come\nKing Kow don't stand for the souls I don't get, it's too slow when the beat moves quick\nFeet don't match in the sheets and chicken\nHonestly we don't mix\nBut the gnome's fallin' the robe still fits\nThe screw still reads it [is/cause ?] I don't mix (oh yeah)\nThe sky don't lie if you crazy\n[?] with me\n[?] hold hands in it\nLemme steal this pain like a cold hand chemist\n[?] get dizzy\nAnd I call back livin' dead\nHarmonies martian and [?]\nPardon me often I fart deep in it\nAnd these stars never fall too far from the lemons\nWhere them thing, living thing, ling a ring\nRun chaos through these streets and\n(rush)\nPound the hound what stays in the trail\nDown de de down deep down to the shell\nSee our old flag ready for the a traipse to his cell\nHey Sid, take a few [?] to the [?]\nIf your [?] fall back take a [?]\n[?]\n[?] and see if I come\n\n[Track 6: Mutts]\n\n[Verse: Mr. Yote]\nI'm sorry for distorting all these army men\nPartially I tend to get so lowdy when they partyin'\nSo hardly many peasants tend to step up to my audience\n'Cause my doubt gets rowdy when I press 'em\nI'll ride with the check and quick dry as I wreck it\nWith bounty on my [?] so keep risin' and wreckin'\nAnd you fuckboys sit and bow our heads when I beckon then\nShyeah, it's okay, but don't hide from me\nAnd anytime my dawg's gettin' pretty\nI promise you plenty drop jaws when I visit\nSilly, I don't need to cause harm but I did it\nSo whatever, you can try and put the gloves on me\nYards of my fleet will drop yards of your meat\nBy any means I bring thee lines by the fall of the trees\nPies give me pleasure when they [?] teeth\nBut whatever finds a way to walk upon my [?]\nI ride through the streets and vice versa breaking freezer\nWhen you turds wishing me and my boys to your knees\nJeez, lil' nasty and cheesy\nNote upon these hard hittin' chicks don't see\n[?] to press charge for the play\nThese cards do swing and bring the large cut trees\nSee my squad keeps a couple old [?] in the name\nWith my nose which is really not at all what I pray to\nHuh, yeah\n\nSometimes I stick prawns in my belly\nThe [?] got me feelin' gassy and chilly\nPass me to Philly, take a smack of the henny\nAnd pretend I got your full blown clip on me\n\n[Outro: Mr. Yote]\n(Now step into the broadband zoo)\n(These dawgs can't move without [?])\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOhEmbed"

        "lyrics": "The Marriage Plot LyricsTo start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\nThere were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.\n\nThere was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.\n\nThere was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn\u2019t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.\n\nAnd then you waited for the result, hoping for \u201cArtistic,\u201d or \u201cPassionate,\u201d thinking you could live with \u201cSensitive,\u201d secretly fearing \u201cNarcissistic\u201d and \u201cDomestic,\u201d but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: \u201cIncurably Romantic.\u201d\n\nThese were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She\u2019d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.\nMadeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she\u2019d been safely couched for the last three hours.\n\nAny higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she\u2019d imbibed last night, and the fact that she\u2019d gone to sleep with her contacts in.\n\nThinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she\u2019d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn\u2019t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.\n\nBut it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.\n\nEarly June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.\n\nBut this sun\u2014the one over Providence\u2014was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who\u2019d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day\u2019s festivities.\n\nAll over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.\n\nAnd, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine\u2019s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.\n\nThe pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.\n\nIt was her parents. She\u2019d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She\u2019d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.\n\nThat Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn\u2019t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.\n\nThe problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn\u2019t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She\u2019d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.\n\nShe considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn\u2019t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she\u2019d have to explain where she\u2019d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.\nThis seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.\n\nIn the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.\n\nShe came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t you hear the bell?\u201d It was Alton\u2019s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely story. Will you let us in, please?\u201d\n\nMadeleine didn\u2019t want to. She needed to wash up first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming down,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton\u2019s response. She pressed it again and said, \u201cDaddy?\u201d but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.\n\nMadeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.\n\nThe thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.\n\nShe lifted her face and pressed speak again.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\nBut it was Phyllida\u2019s voice that answered. \u201cMaddy? What\u2019s the matter? Let us in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy roommates are still asleep. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring the bell anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see your apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring.\u201d\n\nShe took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn\u2019t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.\n\nShe yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Abby said, \u201cwhere did you sneak off to last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI have to go to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re wearing the same clothes, then?\u201d\n\nInstead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she\u2019d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn\u2019t want to identify.\n\nAbby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia\u2019s door and entered. \u201cSo much for Maddy\u2019s broken heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWake up! You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d\n\nThe path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine\u2019s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.\n\nBut Olivia\u2019s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.\n\nShe stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.\n\nThe elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she\u2019d failed to close the sliding gate when she\u2019d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.\n\nNow she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building\u2019s interior gloom.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.\n\nAmong its surviving period details\u2014the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby\u2014was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.\n\nShe ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.\n\nOne of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn\u2019t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.\n\nThe symmetries of her face\u2014the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn\u2013ish cheekbones and jawline\u2014were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.\n\nShe could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,\n\nPhyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter\u2014the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents\u2019 generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn\u2019t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did\u2014before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.\n\nAlton was first through the door. \u201cHere she is!\u201d he said avidly. \u201cThe college graduate!\u201d In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t let us see your apartment,\u201d Phyllida said, coming up next. \u201cI was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We\u2019d love to treat them to dinner later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not staying for dinner,\u201d Alton reminded her.\n\n\u201cWell, we might. That depends on Maddy\u2019s schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father and his plans,\u201d Phyllida said to Madeleine. \u201cAre you wearing that dress to the ceremony?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They\u2019re so mannish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look pretty whacked out, Mad,\u201d Alton said. \u201cBig party last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything of your own to wear?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my robe on, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.\n\nOutside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.\n\nNow, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick\u2019s than to Memorial Day.\n\nAs she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn\u2019t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.\n\n\u201cYour sister sends her regrets,\u201d Phyllida said, coming out.\n\n\u201cShe has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.\u201d\n\nRichard the Lionhearted was Madeleine\u2019s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cOne of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of ultrasounds,\u201d Alton said, \u201cI need to get one on my knee.\u201d\n\nPhyllida paid no attention. \u201cAnyway, Allie\u2019s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they\u2019re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.\u201d\n\nYou had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted\u2019s petite kidney, and already she\u2019d managed to move the subject to Madeleine\u2019s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn\u2019t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.\n\nFortunately, Alton changed the subject. \u201cSo, where do you recommend for breakfast?\u201d\n\nMadeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. \u201cThere\u2019s a place this way.\u201d\n\nShe started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking\u2014moving\u2014seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.\n\nThe sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven\u2019s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.\n\nThe sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these slate sidewalks lovely,\u201d Phyllida said as she followed along.\n\n\u201cWe used to have slate sidewalks on our street.\n\nThey\u2019re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssessed us for the bill, too,\u201d\n\nAlton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.\n\nMadeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.\n\nMadeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.\n\nAs a result, Madeleine\u2019s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.\n\nAnd Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he\u2019d bested her by sheer talent.\n\nAt the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.\n\nA man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.\n\nBy now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida\u2019s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore\u2014the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador\u2014had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida\u2019s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother\u2019s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people\u2019s manners unfavorably with Phyllida\u2019s.\n\nAnd right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine\u2019s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.\n\nIn short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine\u2019s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.\n\nShe plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.\n\nAt a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. \u201cTainted Love\u201d played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.\n\nPhyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d she said tolerantly.\n\n\u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d Alton said.\n\nMadeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees\u2014a large for her\u2014and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.\n\nAlton, who couldn\u2019t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s comfortable?\u201d she inquired in a low voice.\n\nMadeleine turned to see that the girl\u2019s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mummy. Why don\u2019t you go ask her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting poked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to this article,\u201d Alton said, reading the Voice, \u201chomosexuality didn\u2019t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.\u201d\n\nThe coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.\n\nThey were a little burned, but she didn\u2019t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.\n\nPhyllida asked, \u201cSo, are we going to meet Leonard today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cAnything you want us to know about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you two still planning to live together this summer?\u201d\n\nBy this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother\u2019s question was complicated\u2014strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren\u2019t planning on living together, because they\u2019d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn\u2019t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she\u2019d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off\u2014she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cYou can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don\u2019t approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone on record about that,\u201d Alton broke in.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s still a bad idea!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the propriety of it. I\u2019m talking about the practical problems.\n\nIf you move in with Leonard\u2014or any young man\u2014and he\u2019s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.\n\nWhat happens if you two don\u2019t get along? Where are you then? You won\u2019t have any place to live. Or anything to do.\u201d\n\nThat her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn\u2019t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.\n\n\u201cYou quit your job when you met me,\u201d Alton said to Phyllida.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.\n\n\u201cOf course we can, sweetheart. That\u2019s the last I\u2019ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Alton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cBut if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.\n\nWhy not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.\n\nShe could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.\n\nPhyllida brought her out of this reverie.\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your friend Mitchell?\u201d\n\nMadeleine wheeled in her seat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Mitchell. Across the street.\u201d\n\nIn the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite him to join us?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019d love to see Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably waiting for his parents,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nPhyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing sitting on the ground?\u201d Alton asked.\n\nThe three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to ask him, I will,\u201d Phyllida finally said.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go ask him.\u201d\n\nThe day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.\n\nSomeone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, \u201cSussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.\u201d A banner draped over the church entrance read \u201cClass of 1982.\u201d Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.\n\nHis lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.\n\nMadeleine remained a few feet away.\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d she informed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s graduation,\u201d Mitchell replied evenly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s parents are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to say hello to you.\u201d\n\nAt this Mitchell smiled faintly. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t realize you\u2019re not speaking to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cAnd, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder duress or as a change of policy?\u201d\n\nMadeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. \u201cLook. I\u2019m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they\u2019re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Madeleine said, looking away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just being my usual vile self.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell\u2019s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.\n\nWhat had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.\n\nShe\u2019d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.\n\nMadeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.\n\nAt that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,\n\nMadeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she\u2019d been flirting with him in the first place.\n\nThe worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he\u2019d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.\n\nIn the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She\u2019d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she\u2019d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a \u201ccocktease\u201d and claimed that her behavior that night had been \u201cthe erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.\u201d\n\nThe next time they\u2019d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn\u2019t know him, and they hadn\u2019t spoken since.\n\nNow, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, \u201cO.K. Let\u2019s go say hello to your parents.\u201d\n\nPhyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine\u2019s friends, she called out, \u201cI thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell!\u201d Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand. \u201cBig day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.\u201d\n\nThey invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man\u2019s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she\u2019d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.\n\nWhen she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.\n\n\u201cSo, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida was asking, \u201cwhat are your plans after graduation?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s been asking me the same question,\u201d Mitchell answered. \u201cFor some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn\u2019t a marketable degree.\u201d\n\nMadeleine smiled for the first time all day. \u201cSee? Mitchell doesn\u2019t have a job lined up, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I sort of do,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cYou do not,\u201d Madeleine challenged him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I do.\u201d He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.\n\nAt the end of the summer, after they\u2019d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they\u2019d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to India?\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be research assistants,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cFor Prof. Hughes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProf. Hughes in the theater department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw a program about India recently,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cIt was terribly depressing. The poverty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI thrive in squalor.\u201d\n\nPhyllida, who couldn\u2019t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to the right place!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a trip, too,\u201d Madeleine said in a threatening tone.\n\nNo one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, \u201cWhat sort of immunizations do you need for India?\u201d\n\n\u201cCholera and typhus. Gamma globulin\u2019s optional.\u201d\n\nPhyllida shook her head. \u201cYour mother must be worried sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the service,\u201d Alton said, \u201cthey shot us up with a million things. Didn\u2019t even tell us what the shots were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll move to Paris,\u201d Madeleine said in a louder voice. \u201cInstead of getting a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitchell,\u201d Phyllida continued, \u201cwith your interest in religious studies, I\u2019d think India would be a perfect fit. They\u2019ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.\n\nIt\u2019s like Baskin and Robbins! I\u2019ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.\u201d\n\nAlton winked. \u201cI doubt that doubting Thomas existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?\u201d\n\nPhyllida said, keeping Mitchell\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We\u2019d be happy to introduce you. When we\u2019re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It\u2019s simply\u2014well, simply divine!\u201d\n\nPhyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of religious dignitaries,\u201d\n\nAlton cut in, \u201cdid I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?\n\nIt was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,\n\n\u2018Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mortified!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cAbsolutely mortified.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get going if you want to get a good spot.\u201d\n\nAlton looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets really crowded,\u201d Madeleine emphasized. \u201cYou should go now.\u201d\n\nAlton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, \u201cIt does get pretty crowded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to stand?\u201d Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.\n\n\u201cBy the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll come through.\u201d\n\nAlton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cSo nice to see you.\n\nAnd remember, when you\u2019re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she\u2019ll be frantic.\u201d\n\nTo Madeleine, she said, \u201cYou might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.\u201d\n\nWith that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.\n\nAs though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson\u2019s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.\n\nMadeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFamous last words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I? You haven\u2019t been speaking to me.\u201d\n\nWithout lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, \u201cI\u2019m homeless. I\u2019m graduating from college and I\u2019m a homeless person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d Madeleine insisted. \u201cFirst I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I\u2019m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I\u2019d rather kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving back home for the summer,\u201d\n\nMitchell said. \u201cTo Detroit. At least you\u2019re near New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from grad school yet and it\u2019s June,\u201d Madeleine continued.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m scared to find out that I\u2019ve been rejected. As long as I don\u2019t know, I still have hope.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. \u201cYou can come to India with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn\u2019t entirely joking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about grad school,\u201d she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \u201cLeonard and I broke up.\u201d\n\nIt felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d he said.\n\nShe lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you might care,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cSince you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.\n\n\u201cOur wonderful friendship! Our \u2018friendship\u2019 isn\u2019t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.\n\nYou set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don\u2019t want to talk to me for three months, we don\u2019t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents\u2014and now we\u2019re talking again. We\u2019re friends when you want to be friends, and we\u2019re never more than friends because you don\u2019t want to be. And I have to go along with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. \u201cI just don\u2019t like you that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Mitchell cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?\u201d\n\nMadeleine reacted as if she\u2019d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a\u201d\u2014she tried to think of the worst thing to say\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re such a jerk!\u201d\n\nShe was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.\n\nMitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.\n\nConfronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.\n\n\n\nMadeleine\u2019s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.\n\nMichael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He\u2019d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he\u2019d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.\n\nNow Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman\u2019s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman\u2019s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters\u2014Derrida, Eco, Barthes\u2014the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac\u2019s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.\n\nTo get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein\u2019s guru\u2019s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they\u2019d been spiritually vetted and were now\u2014for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least\u2014part of a campus lit-crit elite.\n\nWhich was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She\u2019d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.\n\nThe university\u2019s \u201cBritish and American Literature Course Catalog\u201d was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.\n\nA course listing like \u201cEnglish 274: Lyly\u2019s Euphues\u201d excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. \u201cEnglish 450A:\n\nHawthorne and James\u201d filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach\u2014newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,\n\nThackeray, and Dickens\u2014and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family\u2019s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.\n\nMadeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton\u2019s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida\u2019s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.\n\nEven now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.\n\nIt was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine\u2019s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow\u2019s \u201cHiawatha\u201d that way. She\u2019d read James Fenimore Cooper. She\u2019d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.\n\nAnd yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.\n\nThat left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren\u2019t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical\u2014because they weren\u2019t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they\u2019d done in first grade: reading stories.\n\nEnglish was what people who didn\u2019t know what to major in majored in.\n\nHer junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.\n\nThe class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he\u2019d written twenty or thirty years earlier.\n\nMadeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders\u2019s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.\n\nSexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.\n\nWhat would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?\n\nHow would Isabel Archer\u2019s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?\n\nAs far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn\u2019t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn\u2019t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s final paper for the seminar was titled \u201cThe Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.\u201d\n\nIt had impressed Saunders so much that he\u2019d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.\n\nMadeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.\n\nShe used a line from Trollope\u2019s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:\n\n\u201cThere is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.\u201d\n\nHer plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn\u2019t end with weddings.\n\nThey began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot\u2014the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings\u2014but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.\n\nBy 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.\n\nIn Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress\u2014and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.\n\nThat was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it \u201cwife-swapping\u201d instead of \u201chusband-swapping.\u201d As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.\n\nProfessor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She\u2019d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.\n\nShe felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she\u2019d given him, pointing out various red marks he\u2019d made in the margins.\n\nThen one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby\u2019s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.\n\nWhen Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being \u201cabout\u201d something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was \u201cabout\u201d anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.\n\nMadeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.\n\nCollege wasn\u2019t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.\n\nIn college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying \u201cDerrida.\u201d She heard them saying \u201cLyotard\u201d and \u201cFoucault\u201d and \u201cDeleuze\u201d and \u201cBaudrillard.\u201d\n\nThat most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of\u2014upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols\u2014made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.\n\nAnd Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.\n\nMadeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or\n\nAnne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn\u2019t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.\n\nInstead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.\n\nAnd when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that book like?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I be asking if I had?\u201d\n\nOlivia sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t we a little bitchy today?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s great. Derrida is my absolute god!\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.\n\nThe reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren\u2019t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.\n\nGoing to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism\u2014with sex and power.\n\nMadeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn\u2019t appear to obtain.\n\nIf Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.\n\n\n\nSemiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.\n\nLounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy\u2019s face\u2014it was like a baby\u2019s face that had grown whiskers\u2014and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he\u2019d shaved off his eyebrows.\n\nEveryone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine\u2019s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.\n\nZipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.\n\nThe boy without eyebrows spoke up first. \u201cUm, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.\n\nLike, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.\n\nMy name\u2019s Thurston and I\u2019m from Stamford, Connecticut. I\u2019m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine\u2019s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.\n\nEvery week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure\u2019s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon\u2019s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn\u2019t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.\n\nThree weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein\u2019s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke\u2019s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.\n\nIt was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein\u2019s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.\n\nEveryone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. \u201cWhat did you make of the Handke?\u201d\n\nAfter a short silence, Thurston spoke up. \u201cThe Handke was totally dank and depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\nThurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, Professor, here\u2019s a subject dear to my heart\u2014offing yourself.\u201d The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I\u2019d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you\u2019re treating actual events.\u201d\n\nBart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.\n\nMeanwhile Thurston was saying, \u201cSo Handke\u2019s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally\u2014remorseless!\u201d\n\nThurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother\u2019s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. \u201cSuicide is a trope,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cEspecially in German literature. You\u2019ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You\u2019ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.\u201d He held up a finger.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther.\u201d He held up another finger.\n\n\u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean \u2018free\u2019?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cFrom the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.\u201d\n\nThe flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s more the translator\u2019s doing than Handke\u2019s. In German the book\u2019s called Wunschloses Ungl\u00fcck.\u201d\n\nThurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein\u2019s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a play on a German saying, wunschlos gl\u00fccklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It\u2019s a serious and strangely wonderful title.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nZipperstein looked at her for the first time.\n\n\u201cIn a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the book?\u201d Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.\n\nPeople blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.\n\nBefore the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.\n\n\u201cI have a comment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was going to write about my mother\u2019s suicide, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too concerned about being experimental.\u201d He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.\n\n\u201cI mean, wasn\u2019t anybody put off by Handke\u2019s so-called remorselessness? Didn\u2019t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter cold than sentimental,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cDo you think? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We\u2019ve read it a million times. It doesn\u2019t have any power anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a little thought experiment here,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cSay my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.\n\nWhy would I want to do something like that?\u201d He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.\n\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think your reaction is universal,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cThat because you\u2019d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that if your mother kills herself it\u2019s not a literary trope.\u201d\n\nMadeleine\u2019s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.\n\nThurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn\u2019t suggest agreement.\n\n\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cHandke\u2019s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that\u2019s not what this book\u2019s about. Books aren\u2019t about \u2018real life.\u2019 Books are about other books.\u201d He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful\u2014like suicide\u2014when all of the writing that\u2019s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?\u201d\n\nWhat Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\n\u201c\u2018Popular literature,\u2019\u201d Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. \u201c\u2018Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.\u2019\u201d\n\nA spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.\n\nShe started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff\u2019s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.\n\nIt was Madeleine\u2019s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn\u2019t having any. She\u2019d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.\n\nLooking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn\u2019t want to be shown Jennifer\u2019s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, \u201cDid you put your diaphragm in?\u201d They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.\n\nThough Madeleine hadn\u2019t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she\u2019d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He\u2019d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine\u2019s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine\u2019s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201csorry,\u201d and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.\n\nAt Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents\u2019 bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.\n\n\u201cAm I not getting asked out because I\u2019m fat,\u201d the chipmunk said, \u201cor am I fat because I\u2019m not getting asked out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never got the freshman fifteen,\u201d her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t pig out like all my friends did.\u201d Accustomed to Alwyn\u2019s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year\u2019s.\n\nDieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn\u2019t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane\u2019s A Love Supreme. It wasn\u2019t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.\n\nBilly didn\u2019t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn\u2019t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.\n\nOne thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cCut off part of its dick? What\u2019s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby\u2019s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.\u201d Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.\n\n\u201cThe doctors just do it automatically in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask my parents. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m Jewish or anything.\u201d He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. \u201cMaybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn\u2019t take a shower. But now?\u201d\n\nOne night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the scar,\u201d he said somberly.\n\nHe interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,\n\n\u201cBut does it feel supersensitive?\u201d Billy was convinced that he\u2019d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine\u2019s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy\u2019s opinion, college was all about.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d he asked Madeleine. \u201cIs it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my case,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cmy father really is my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cGodard,\u201d he said.\n\nBilly talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy\u2019s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon\u2013style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.\n\nMaddy\u2019s next boyfriend wasn\u2019t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn\u2019t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn\u2019t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.\n\n\u201cActing wasn\u2019t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,\u201d was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had \u201crun away\u201d to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she\u2019d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She\u2019d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and \u201cloads of invitations.\u201d She\u2019d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She\u2019d developed a lustrous suntan she described as \u201cEgyptian.\u201d Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida\u2019s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she\u2019d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. \u201cAnd had you two,\u201d she told her daughters.\n\nPhyllida\u2019s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother\u2019s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine\u2019s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug\u2019s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.\n\nIf they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter what Alton said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn\u2019t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as \u201cThe Battle of the Sexes,\u201d and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine\u2019s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you\u2019d just been creamed?\n\nAt the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nDabney Carlisle stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.\u201d\n\nThe modeling he\u2019d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl\u2013ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn\u2019t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney\u2019s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn\u2019t) and how much he\u2019d gotten paid (\u201cfour figures\u201d) and what the other guys were like (\u201ctotal a-holes\u201d) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time\u2014Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated\u2014Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.\n\nLooking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney\u2019s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney\u2019s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine\u2019s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening\u2019s \u201cHawaiian Night\u201d were still there to see\u2014the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic \u201cgrass\u201d skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney\u2019s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine\u2019s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn\u2019t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,\n\n\u201cNow you see it, now you don\u2019t, now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d; that such a thing wasn\u2019t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.\n\nWhat she hadn\u2019t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she\u2019d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn\u2019t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.\n\nActing opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet\u2019s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.\n\nDabney didn\u2019t let it bother him. \u201cBunch of little shits in that class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get any print work, much less movies.\u201d\n\nHe was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney\u2019s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She\u2019d never been in a relationship where she wasn\u2019t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney\u2019s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she\u2019d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn\u2019t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.\n\nAnd so she began to tell herself that Dabney\u2019s acting was \u201crestrained\u201d or \u201ceconomical.\u201d She appreciated that Dabney was \u201csecure about himself\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t need to prove anything\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cshowoff.\u201d Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney\u2019s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write\u2014O.K., she wrote\u2014English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A\u2019s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the \u201cfaggots\u201d who hadn\u2019t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn\u2019t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn\u2019t even smile right.\n\nAt the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. \u201cGive it to me straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You\u2019ve got it right now. The crease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nChurchill, steepling his fingers, continued, \u201cI\u2019d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don\u2019t want to be a professional actress, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.\u201d\n\nWhen Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Madeleine asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m perfect for soaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoap commercials?\u201d\n\nDabney looked peeved. \u201cDays of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he mean that as a compliment?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I\u2019ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I\u2019m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was silent at this news. She\u2019d assumed Dabney\u2019s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Dabney asked her.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the theater doesn\u2019t mean \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t act,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cHe did, huh?\u201d Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tearing down your crit. I\u2019m just not sure you got Churchill\u2019s meaning, exactly.\u201d\n\nDabney let out a bitter laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get it right, would I? I\u2019m too dumb. I\u2019m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, am I ever lucky,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do if you weren\u2019t around?\n\nYou have to catch all the subtleties for me, don\u2019t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.\n\nWhat do you know about needing to make a living?\n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn\u2019t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.\n\nYou know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I\u2019m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill\u2019s right. You can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\nIn the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she\u2019d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.\n\n\n\nMadeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She\u2019d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine\u2019s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn\u2019t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine\u2019s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,\n\n\u201cCan you help me? The printer\u2019s not being nice.\u201d The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,\n\nMadeleine cooly answered, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.\n\nShe arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. \u201cAt the annual dancers\u2019 ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?\u201d Logic wasn\u2019t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn\u2019t a subject Madeleine\u2019s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn\u2019t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.\n\nOne afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton\u2019s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,\n\nWirth said, \u201cNow\u2019s the calm before the calm.\u201d He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.\n\nInstead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.\n\n\u201cCut it close on the sides, higher on top,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.\n\nThe Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine\u2019s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn\u2019t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.\n\nHe shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard\u2019s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn\u2019t help staring back a significant moment longer.\n\nOne evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.\n\n\u201cThink about it, though,\u201d Leonard was saying to the girl. \u201cThink about it from the point of view of the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., I\u2019m a fly,\u201d the girl said with a throaty laugh.\n\n\u201cWe move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, \u2018Wake me when the swatter gets close.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, \u201cJust a sec.\u201d\n\nMadeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.\n\n\u201cPicking up the Balzac?\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBalzac to the rescue.\u201d\n\nNormally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn\u2019t even remember to smile until he\u2019d looked away.\n\nBettie Page came back with Madeleine\u2019s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,\n\n\u201cMy house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d the girl asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proportional,\u201d Leonard explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re five, you\u2019ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you\u2019re fifty, you\u2019ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you\u2019re five seems longer because it\u2019s a greater percentage of the whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d the girl teased, \u201cthat follows.\u201d\n\nBut Madeleine had understood. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI always wondered why that was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a theory,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nBettie Page tapped Leonard\u2019s hand to get his attention.\n\n\u201cFlies aren\u2019t always so fast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve caught flies in my bare hands before.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially in winter,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the kind of fly I\u2019d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.\u201d\n\nThere was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.\n\nShe began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she\u2019d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.\n\nIn Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco\u2019s The Role of the Reader. It hadn\u2019t done much for Madeleine. She wasn\u2019t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.\n\nWhereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn\u2019t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida\u2019s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler\u2019s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.\n\n\u201cThe Culler was passable at best,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about it?\u201d the professor asked him.\n\nThurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. \u201cIt\u2019s readable and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd well argued and all that. But it\u2019s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse\u2014like, say, reason\u2014to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.\u201d\n\nMadeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It\u2019s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it\u2019s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida\u2019s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.\u201d He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. \u201cCuller, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.\u201d\n\nA silence ensued. And deepened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but wasn\u2019t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.\u201d\n\nThurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. But Culler\u2019s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That\u2019s what Culler is for Derrida.\u201d\n\nMadeleine shrugged this off. \u201cI got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.\u201d\n\nThurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a simplification to be simple,\u201d he said.\n\nClass ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were on my side. Why didn\u2019t you say anything in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst Law of Thermodynamics,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cConservation of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the Culler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Culler\u2019s good. But Derrida\u2019s a heavyweight. You can\u2019t just write him off.\u201d\n\nMadeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn\u2019t who she was mad at. \u201cConsidering how Thurston\u2019s always going on about how much he worships language, you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.\u201d\n\nLeonard smiled. \u201cFigures if he says it it\u2019ll be like having one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe drives me crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to get some coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd fascist. That\u2019s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have gone extra heavy on the starch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYes, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just invited me for coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did?\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYes, I did. O.K. Let\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn\u2019t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.\n\nAs they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.\n\n\u201cPardon my disgusting habit,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine wrinkled up her nose. \u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I do it. It\u2019s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.\u201d\n\nAt the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.\n\nWithin a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.\n\nLeonard wanted to sit at the counter. \u201cI need to be close to the pies,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see which one is talking to me.\u201d\n\nAs Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.\n\n\u201cDo you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked it. I\u2019m just mourning its passage.\u201d\n\nThe conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.\n\nThe waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.\n\n\u201cSo why are you taking Zipperstein\u2019s class?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPhilosophical interest,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cLiterally. Philosophy\u2019s all about theory of language right now. It\u2019s all linguistics. So I figured I\u2019d check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a biology major, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I really am,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThe philosophy\u2019s just a sideline.\u201d\n\nMadeleine realized that she\u2019d never dated a science major.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now all I want to do is get the waitress\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nLeonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, \u201cIs it hot in here?\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard\u2019s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness\u2014the delicacy, almost\u2014of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, though,\u201d Leonard said, still staring in the waitress\u2019s direction,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it\u2019s more like, \u2018What do we mean when we say we die?\u2019\n\n\u2018What do we mean we mean when we say we die?\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.\n\n\u201cHow very female of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cCottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like cottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you on a diet? You don\u2019t look like someone on a diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nAnd here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. \u201cJust curious,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. \u201cDerrida\u2019s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,\u201d he said. \u201cRumor has it his prose in French is limpid.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should read it in French, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know French?\u201d Leonard said, sounding impressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great. I can read Flaubert.\u201d\n\nIt was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising\u2014even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine\u2019s collapsible umbrella\u2014that a feeling came over her like those she\u2019d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or \u00e9clair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.\n\nThey didn\u2019t kiss goodbye. They didn\u2019t come close to it.\n\nLeonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said \u201cBye\u201d and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn\u2019t move for a long time.\n\nThe days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard\u2019s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn\u2019t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine\u2019s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.\n\nThe next week he missed class entirely.\n\nAnd so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.\n\nBy now they had moved on to Derrida\u2019s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: \u201cIn that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.\u201d In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: \u201cWhat writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit\u2019s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.\u201d\n\nSince Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn\u2019t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could \u201cthe access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality\u201d really be a subject?)\n\nReading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something\u2014anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda\u2014to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.\n\nThen, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.\n\nThe next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She\u2019d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn\u2019t show up. Madeleine worried that he\u2019d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,\n\n\u201cHas anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?\u201d Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra\u2019s bare shoulder,\n\n\u201cNot Real Skin.\u201d\n\nZipperstein was in a lively mood. He\u2019d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he\u2019d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein\u2019s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he\u2019d bought deconstruction.\n\nHe sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:\n\n\u201cI hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.\u201d\n\nThat was it. That was Zipperstein\u2019s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.\n\nMadeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She\u2019d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.\n\nBut then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.\n\nIt was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn\u2019t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes\u2019 other works.\n\nMadeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.\n\nOpening to the introduction, she began to read:\n\nThe necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover\u2019s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.\n\nOutside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.\n\nMadeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:\n\nWhat we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: \u201cTo the United Readers and Lovers.\u201d)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn\u2019t only that these opening sentences of Barthes\u2019 made immediate sense. It wasn\u2019t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn\u2019t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.\n\nIt had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn\u2019t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.\n\nIn recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.\n\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cSort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he just wanted to talk. He\u2019d keep me on the phone for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He\u2019d go on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was he going out with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That\u2019s when he really started calling me. He\u2019d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That\u2019s what he\u2019s like.\u201d She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. \u201cWhy are you asking? Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just know him from class,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to invite him for dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invite him to dinner,\u201d Abby said.\n\nThe dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He\u2019d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.\n\nMadeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis must be an old gas main,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.\n\n\u201cThey used to have gas lamps in these old places,\u201d Leonard went on.\n\n\u201cThey probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody\u2019s pilot blew out, on any floor, you\u2019d have a leak. Gas didn\u2019t have an odor back then, either. They didn\u2019t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThis place must have been a powder keg.\u201d Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been going to class,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d\n\nIn the living room Olivia called out, \u201cWho wants some Delamain? It\u2019s yummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want some,\u201d Brian Weeger said. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s killer.\u201d\n\nLeonard said, \u201cWere the dish towels all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re great,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect. We\u2019ll use them! Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have brought wine, or scotch, but that\u2019s the kind of thing my father would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything your father would do?\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, \u201cMy father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I\u2019m from. My dad\u2019s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.\u201d\n\nThis interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.\n\n\u201cWhat does your father do?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. \u201cHe used to work at a college,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he? Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the president.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face twitched. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small college. In New Jersey. It\u2019s called Baxter.\u201d\n\nAbby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, \u201cThere\u2019s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.\u201d\n\nMadeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s playing on Saturday,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like Fellini?\u201d\n\nTo reply to this question did not, in Madeleine\u2019s view, compromise her rule.\n\n\u201cYou want to know something embarrassing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Fellini film.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see one,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It\u2019s the same as Abby\u2019s number.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to write it down?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nAnd he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.\n\n\u201cSome guy called yesterday,\u201d Olivia said, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it sound like Leonard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice. I was dripping wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for taking a message!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorree,\u201d Olivia said.\n\n\u201cGod. It was just a two-second call. He said he\u2019d call back later.\u201d\n\nAnd so now it was Friday night\u2014Friday night!\u2014and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover\u2019s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.\n\n\n\nWaiting\nattente / waiting\nTumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).\n\u2026 Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) \u2026\n\nShe could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine\u2019s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn\u2019t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.\n\nThe more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn\u2019t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she\u2019d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nMadeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d\n\nIt was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.\n\n\u201cOh. Hi, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\nIn his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. \u201cYour mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s April,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduation\u2019s not until June.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we\u2019re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.\n\nIn the phone Alton\u2019s voice was saying,\n\n\u201cOption one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It\u2019s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.\n\n\u201cHi, dear. I hope we didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t wake her,\u201d Alton barked. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock\u2019s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, ignoring him.\n\n\u201cMaddy, sweetie, we\u2019re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re redoing my bedroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it needs freshening up. I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy room?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Madeleine cried.\n\n\u201cMaddy, we\u2019ve kept your room the way it is for four years now\u2014you\u2019d think it was a shrine! I\u2019d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll always be your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my wallpaper?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s old. It\u2019s peeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change my wallpaper!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Alton said in a peremptory tone. \u201cThis call is about graduation. Phyl, you\u2019re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you\u2019ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties\u2014and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night\u2014or two nights\u2014if we\u2019re going to see you. But if you\u2019re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraduation\u2019s two months away. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told your father,\u201d Phyllida said.\n\nIt occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.\n\n\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay the night,\u201d Alton repeated, \u201cI\u2019d like to make reservations soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.\u201d\n\nAlton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,\n\nMadeleine picked up and said,\n\n\u201cDaddy, stop it. We don\u2019t have to decide tonight.\u201d\n\nThere was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He\u2019s freaking out about graduation plans already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just having a little freak-out myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout calling you.\u201d\n\nThis was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, \u201cHave you calmed down or do you want to call back later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m resting comfortably now, thank you.\u201d\n\nMadeleine waited for more. None came. \u201cAre you calling for a reason?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you\u2019re not too, I know it\u2019s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.\u201d\n\nLeonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn\u2019t good. Madeleine didn\u2019t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was a complete sentence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I leave out?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\n\u201cHow about, \u2018Would you like to come with me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nMadeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, \u201cSorry. Not funny.\u201d He comically cleared his throat. \u201cListen, would you like to go to the movies with me?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him\u2014for another three seconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.\n\nThe next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they\u2019d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.\n\nShe had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren\u2019t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqu\u00e9 European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero\u2019s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, \u201cI want a woman!\u201d Fellini\u2019s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes\u2019\u2014love\u2014but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel na\u00efve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.\n\nAfter it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn\u2019t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.\u201d\n\nThe downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.\n\n\u201cMy goal in life is to become an adjective,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPeople would go around saying, \u2018That was so Bankheadian.\u2019 Or, \u2018A little too Bankheadian for my taste.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBankheadian has a ring,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than Bankheadesque.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Bankheadish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsh is terrible all around. There\u2019s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who\u2019s an ish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Mannish?\u201d\n\n\u201cKafkaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPynchonesque! See, Pynchon\u2019s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do it with Gaddis,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cTough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI read a little of The Recognitions,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nThey turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.\n\n\u201cBellovian,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt\u2019s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Tolstoyanism,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d Leonard said. \u201cA noun! I\u2019ve never even dreamed of being a noun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would Bankheadian mean?\u201d\n\nLeonard thought for a second. \u201c\u2018Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.\u2019\u201d\n\nMadeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this time we\u2019ve been walking? I\u2019ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It\u2019s shameful. Shameful. I don\u2019t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured we were going back to your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to call you on it. When we got closer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already close.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStubborn. Given to ironclad positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannarian,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cDangerous. Not to be messed with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand warned.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come up just for a minute,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial Days\u201d\nf\u00eate / festivity\nThe amorous subject experiences every meeting\nwith the loved being as a festival.\n1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the \u201csource of all good things.\u201d\n\u201cI am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.\u201d\n\nIt was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she\u2019d seen him. She hadn\u2019t even known him then, and so what she\u2019d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they\u2019d gone out for coffee, she couldn\u2019t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard\u2019s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she\u2019d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn\u2019t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she\u2019d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,\n\n\u201cSure. Martinis. We can pretend we\u2019re Salinger characters\u201d; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they\u2019d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn\u2019t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she\u2019d just spent the whole night worrying wasn\u2019t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they\u2019d spent the next three days at Leonard\u2019s place having sex and eating pizza, after she\u2019d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she\u2019d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.\n\nLeonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants\u2019 doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard\u2019s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:\n\n\u201cYou go. I like it here.\u201d\n\nMadeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.\n\nA ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watering my tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe soil\u2019s dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of my tree.\u201d\n\nShe stopped doing it after that.\n\nThere was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.\n\nThe apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn\u2019t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.\n\nWhat did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She\u2019d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard\u2019s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it \u201chaving a heavy.\u201d If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a heavy.\u201d And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.\n\nGoing out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn\u2019t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.\n\nPeople often fell in love with their shrinks, didn\u2019t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink\u2019s couch was already a bed?\n\nAnd plus it wasn\u2019t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. \u201cDid I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.\n\nDo you know what a kokle is?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I\u2019d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they\u2019d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was \u2018Otchi Tchornyia.\u2019 That\u2019s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you still play?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?\u201d\n\nListening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, \u201cWhat do you do? Just hold it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.\u201d\n\nAs his meaning seeped in, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your presence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I am present. Or nearby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Nothing. If you\u2019re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that\u2019s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cO.K.? I find it embarrassing.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared at her without expression and said, \u201cDo you mind when I take a dump?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to talk about this? It\u2019s sort of gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we do need to talk about it. Because you\u2019re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am\u2014or thought I was\u2014your boyfriend, and that means\u2014or should mean\u2014that I\u2019m the person you\u2019re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.\u201d\n\nGuys weren\u2019t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren\u2019t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He\u2019d said he was her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d too. He\u2019d made it official.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more relaxed,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cif it\u2019ll make you happy. But in terms of\u2014excretion\u2014don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.\u201d\n\nEven though this kind of amateur therapy didn\u2019t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.\n\nBy the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she\u2019d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine\u2019s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard\u2019s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn\u2019t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn\u2019t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was \u201cclean-sheet day\u201d every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she\u2019d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.\n\n\u201cYou never wash your sheets!\u201d she complained.\n\n\u201cI wash them,\u201d Leonard said evenly.\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with \u2018clean-sheet day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop them off,\u201d Madeleine said, undeterred. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a washer in the basement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI use the washer,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cJust not every Wednesday. I don\u2019t equate dirt with death and decay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and I do? I\u2019m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it, Leonard!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s salami. I don\u2019t like liverwurst.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter\u2019s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.\n\nHe started finishing Madeleine\u2019s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn\u2019t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn\u2019t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover\u2019s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn\u2019t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.\n\nThe more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere\u2014the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks\u2014made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn\u2019t read Roland Barthes. They didn\u2019t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.\n\nOn a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard\u2019s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard\u2019s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he\u2019d been napping.\n\n\u201cNiiiiice dress,\u201d he said.\n\nThey never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn\u2019t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She\u2019d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she\u2019d been in love before. She knew she\u2019d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other\u2019s eyes as they came\u2014none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.\n\nLeonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard\u2019s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover\u2019s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.\n\nI Love You\nje-t\u2019aime / I-love-you\n\nAs she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine\u2019s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren\u2019t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.\n\nOnce the first avowal has been made, \u201cI love you\" has no meaning whatever \u2026\n\nLeonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.\n\nIt was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.Embed"

Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English student and incurable romantic, is writing her thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot \u2013 authors of the great marriage plots. As Madeleine studies the age-old motivations of the human heart, real life, in the form of two very different men, intervenes.\n\nLeonard Bankhead, brilliant scientist and charismatic loner, attracts Madeleine with an intensity that she seems powerless to resist. Meanwhile, her old friend Mitchell Grammaticus, a theology student searching for some kind of truth in life, is certain of at least one thing \u2013 that he and Madeleine are destined to be together.\n\nBut as all three leave college, they will have to figure out how they want their own marriage plot to end."
