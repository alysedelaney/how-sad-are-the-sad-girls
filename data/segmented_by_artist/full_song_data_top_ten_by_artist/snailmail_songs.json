Doesn't it?\nAnd if you do find someone better\nI'll still see you in everything\nFor always, tomorrow, and all the time\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you like me for me?\nIs there any better feeling than coming clean?\nAnd I know myself and I'll never love anyone else\nI won't love anyone else\nI'll never love anyone else\n\n[Bridge]\nIf it's not supposed to be\nThen I'll just let it be\nAnd out of everyone\nBe honest with me\nWho do you change for?\nWho's top of your world?\nAnd out of everyone\nWho's your type of girl?\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAnd we can be anything\nEven apart\nAnd out of everything\nIt doesn't have to be this hard\nI could be anyone but I'm so entwined\nAnd out of everyone\nWho's on your mind?\nNo more changes\nI'll still love you the same19Embed"

            "plain": "\u201cGlory\u201d sees Lindsey Jordan singing to the same subject of \u201cMadonna\u201d, recognizing that no matter how they try to control the relationship, they own her. Even as she demands that they owe her, wresting agency from them, they control her more than anyone else. She said of the song:\n\nIt\u2019s like no matter how angry I am and no matter how much I try to make this something where I\u2019m in control and I\u2019m the one making demands, at the end of the day I still would do anything for the subject of the song. No matter how in control I feel, I don\u2019t even feel like I belong to myself because I\u2019m so entwined in this person\u2019s life.\n\nThe guitar tone and style is reminiscent of her debut album Lush."

            "plain": "\u201cHeat Wave\u201d is the second single off Snail Mail\u2019s debut album Lush. It was released on April 26, 2018. It was accompanied with a music video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d91Qn8QUks\n\n\u2018Heat Wave\u2019 is a modern love song. We typically live for ourselves \u2013 our jobs, our brands, our self-development. But that leaves little time and energy for others and results in alienation from others and our humanity. Over the course of this song, Lindsay Jordan contemplates her unrequited love for another person chasing personal novelty as opposed to love. Lindsay ultimately chooses to live for her humanity and to seek deep romantic connection.\n\nThe title of the track is the perfect backdrop to the feelings of lethargy and \u201ccomfort\u201d of not moving on and staying stuck on the same person. A heat wave evokes feelings of half-hearted acceptance at the thought of staying still and not doing anything and procrastinating on life (a common theme throughout Lindsey\u2019s music)."

                  "plain": "\u201cHeat Wave\u201d is the second single off Snail Mail\u2019s debut album Lush. It was released on April 26, 2018. It was accompanied with a music video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d91Qn8QUks\n\n\u2018Heat Wave\u2019 is a modern love song. We typically live for ourselves \u2013 our jobs, our brands, our self-development. But that leaves little time and energy for others and results in alienation from others and our humanity. Over the course of this song, Lindsay Jordan contemplates her unrequited love for another person chasing personal novelty as opposed to love. Lindsay ultimately chooses to live for her humanity and to seek deep romantic connection.\n\nThe title of the track is the perfect backdrop to the feelings of lethargy and \u201ccomfort\u201d of not moving on and staying stuck on the same person. A heat wave evokes feelings of half-hearted acceptance at the thought of staying still and not doing anything and procrastinating on life (a common theme throughout Lindsey\u2019s music)."

Starting off with eerie sci-fi synths, it builds up to a phenomenal chorus, written in the studio.\nIn the Pitchfork interview, Lindsey revealed:\n\nThe song \u201cValentine\u201d used to be called \u201cAdore You,\u201d but then I came up with that chorus\u2014\u201cWhy\u2019d you wanna erase me, darling valentine?\u201d\u2014and I knew the record would be called Valentine. I was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s heartbreaking, that\u2019s so Snail Mail.\u201d"

Lush may have covered getting over unrequited love, but the real pain of Valentine is that this love was requited at one point. As the verses swell to the chorus, Jordan offers some perspective into why the break happened; She had a very idealistic picture of love, as well as grand expectations that her ex-girlfriend could not meet. She found herself being too suffocating and \u201cloving enough for two\u201d."

              "The song begins very minimal, only with eighties-esque synth gently lowering the listener into a pot of lyrics that are slowly rising in heat to the boiling anguish heard in the chorus.\n\nThe opening verse takes on a paranoid tone, as we see Jordan and her lover attempt to escape the public eye. Since her debut album shot her into recognition when she was just becoming an adult and entering real romantic relationships, Jordan found it overwhelming to be so noticed. In \u201cValentine\u201d\u2019s demo \u201cAdore You\u201d this verse was originally sung as:\n\nLet\u2019s go be alone\nWhere no one can see us, honey\nThe scum in every room\nForget about the cameras when they stop to stare at you\nBoth grew up so soon\nNow summer\u2019s never ending\nThere and then, I knew\nNever been in love, but I think I was made for you\n\nThese original lyrics go more in depth about being young and famous, as well as Jordan\u2019s naive outlook on love at the time. She may be concerned that the people she meets would rather use her for fame than befriend them, and being intimate with another person may be difficult when it is already so hard to be alone. She almost feels apologetic to her lover, shameful that the both of them have to keep up appearances instead of being genuine with each other."

The music video for this song features Jordan as a chambermaid having an affair with an aristocratic Victorian woman. These lyrics are sung over Jordan seeing her lover hold the hand of a man in public. She sings the lyrics as if to say, \u201cWhy do you insist on keeping our love a secret and in the process erasing me from the historical narrative?\u201d\n\nThis is also supported by the inclusion of the line \u201cFuck being remembered\u201d in the previous verse.

It\u2019s almost like the sadness within the song has to be taken seriously and not painted over with major chords and heavy drums.\n\nThe lyrics describe a failing relationship, perhaps describing a tough transition from high school to adult life. The lyrics sound like a conversation between two people, which makes the \u201cI\u2019ll see you around\u201d all the more poignant. The swell in instrumental and change in chords and rhythm breaks the song into a different mood, maybe signifying the emotional departure."

It\u2019s almost like the sadness within the song has to be taken seriously and not painted over with major chords and heavy drums.\n\nThe lyrics describe a failing relationship, perhaps describing a tough transition from high school to adult life. The lyrics sound like a conversation between two people, which makes the \u201cI\u2019ll see you around\u201d all the more poignant. The swell in instrumental and change in chords and rhythm breaks the song into a different mood, maybe signifying the emotional departure."

It helped her receive more attention in the indie rock community and got her signed to Matador."

While this song has been performed in her live shows, it was only recently recorded and released through Amazon Originals.\n\nThe \u201c2nd most beautiful girl in the world\u201d is probably referring not to the subject of the song, but the girl who has fallen for her. Therefore the writer is referring to herself in third person as she describes being in love."

I was dealing with a unique set of circumstances and challenges rooted in being so young when I started. I needed to hit pause. I was not in any kind of shape to continue doing Snail Mail stuff. Luckily, I had people around me that love me, and the place that I went to had a lot of answers.\n\nWhen asked if she considered not including this line she said\n\nOne hundred percent. I had to figure out how I felt about it, like, \u201cAm I just going to tell everybody? Am I embarrassed? Am I ashamed?\u201d I told my close friends in an Instagram story where I said, \u201cHere\u2019s the address, write me a letter.\u201d There was a moment where I wasn\u2019t going to put it in the album, and then I was like, \u201cI fucking feel like it!\u201d At the very least, if I\u2019m putting this information out there maybe it will encourage other people to not be ashamed to get help or talk about it."
