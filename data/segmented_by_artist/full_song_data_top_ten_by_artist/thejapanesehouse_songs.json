And I was thinking a lot about how I don\u2019t really feel like a woman or a girl, and so it\u2019s strange \u2018cause I grew up as a girl and I didn\u2019t have a boyhood. I was sort of thinking about that and how different I might be if I\u2019ve had some sort of boyhood or I\u2019ve had some different things happened to me in my life. The song itself had a hundred different versions of it and I feel like I\u2019ve had a hundred different versions of myself that could\u2019ve existed and it\u2019s about like accepting some of those\u2026\u201d"

And I was thinking a lot about how I don\u2019t really feel like a woman or a girl, and so it\u2019s strange \u2018cause I grew up as a girl and I didn\u2019t have a boyhood. I was sort of thinking about that and how different I might be if I\u2019ve had some sort of boyhood or I\u2019ve had some different things happened to me in my life. The song itself had a hundred different versions of it and I feel like I\u2019ve had a hundred different versions of myself that could\u2019ve existed and it\u2019s about like accepting some of those\u2026\u201d"

In the first line, the speaker, unable to find a purpose in their individual existence, instead looks outward. Their avoidance of defining themself by their own standards has allowed their identity to morph into something foreign, because it has been shaped by opinions and expectations outside themself.\n\nAs the artist has stated, this song deals with how there is no larger meaning to life \u2014 that perhaps a value of sorts can be found, instead, in how our love of others can give our life meaning and value.\n\n\u201cFinding themself\u201d then, as stated here, is not that there is a disconnect between who they are as an individual, and who they want to be \u2014 but that it isn\u2019t literally themself that they found at all. Instead, what they found was a personal reason to live in living for their love of another. \u201cI\u2019m someone else\u201d is, then, just that: that it was in loving someone else that they found this purpose to life. This sentiment is supported in the third and sixth lines of the chorus: \u201cMaybe you\u2019re the reason.\u201d The love of another is how the speaker has made peace with this existential angst of the absence of divine direction in life."

I need to make it something nice. I thought about my girlfriend at the time, and how maybe loving someone is the reason you live? It\u2019s the cheesiest chorus ever, but I think it needed it."

            "plain": "The song \u2018Chewing Cotton Wool\u2019 chronicles the mourning process over a love lost; of a relationship that\u2019s come to an end. Through metaphors and references, both the omnipresence and unattainability of the loved one is evoked.\n\nIn the song\u2019s closing line \u2013 from which the track and the EP as a whole take their name \u2013 songwriter Amber Baines refers to this lover to be \u201cchewing cotton wool\u201d, a reference to this loved one\u2019s (metaphorical or literal) death. In the act of conserving the body of a deceased person, an embalmer/mortician often places cotton gauze in the throat and mouth of the deceased to prevent leakage of bodily fluids and to make the mouth look more natural.\n\nAs with many of the songs on her album \u2018Good At Falling\u2019, this song \u2013 and the other tracks on the EP \u2013 closely relate to the relationship Amber Baines had with fellow British Singer-Songwriter Marika Hackman and the processing of the break-up."

                  "plain": "The song \u2018Chewing Cotton Wool\u2019 chronicles the mourning process over a love lost; of a relationship that\u2019s come to an end. Through metaphors and references, both the omnipresence and unattainability of the loved one is evoked.\n\nIn the song\u2019s closing line \u2013 from which the track and the EP as a whole take their name \u2013 songwriter Amber Baines refers to this lover to be \u201cchewing cotton wool\u201d, a reference to this loved one\u2019s (metaphorical or literal) death. In the act of conserving the body of a deceased person, an embalmer/mortician often places cotton gauze in the throat and mouth of the deceased to prevent leakage of bodily fluids and to make the mouth look more natural.\n\nAs with many of the songs on her album \u2018Good At Falling\u2019, this song \u2013 and the other tracks on the EP \u2013 closely relate to the relationship Amber Baines had with fellow British Singer-Songwriter Marika Hackman and the processing of the break-up."

The single was released on the 27th of September, 2018 on Zane Lowe\u2019s Hottest Record feature on Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1 radio station.\n\nThe track focuses on a relationship Bain previously had, brought about after being introduced by close friend Gemma Janes. The imagery of a Lilo floating in a pool describes how the relationship felt, serene and easygoing.\n\nBain continues with the thematic use of water, as she had previously in \u201cPools to Bathe In\u201d, \u201cCool Blue\u201d, \u201cLetter By The Water\u201d, and \u201cSwim Against the Tide\u201d."

The single was released on the 27th of September, 2018 on Zane Lowe\u2019s Hottest Record feature on Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1 radio station.\n\nThe track focuses on a relationship Bain previously had, brought about after being introduced by close friend Gemma Janes. The imagery of a Lilo floating in a pool describes how the relationship felt, serene and easygoing.\n\nBain continues with the thematic use of water, as she had previously in \u201cPools to Bathe In\u201d, \u201cCool Blue\u201d, \u201cLetter By The Water\u201d, and \u201cSwim Against the Tide\u201d."

This is even proven by a line earlier in the song; \u201cI saw myself an intellectual, I thought that I was capable\u201d which lays out her inability to do or feel something that she had overestimated herself on."

              "Going into a relationship there can be challenges we should be able to face with a level head and through logical thinking, but finding yourself in the middle of it is very different to looking back on the relationship. This person was caught up in the waves of the relationship so much that aspects of it became a habit and a ritual. It could be seen that this is the only place in the song where a tinge of regret is felt, as she thought she was capable of holding the relationship together; which contrasts to the overall acceptance the rest of the lyrics portray."
