Now looking back, Ethel laments that she had built too much trust for religion in her youth when its abuse would cause her so much trauma.\n\nSimilarly, high school football is a staple of small-town life in America, with it being common for almost the whole community to come together to cheer on their team. Like her relationship with the church, Ethel regrets growing so much love for the local football team and thus her town when she is hurt by its people and feels like an outcast."

In an interview with W Magazine, Anhed\u00f6nia explains:\n\n\u201cIt never so much for me was about god. It was more for me about the way people were interacting with each other in the name of god. All of the personal drama was really weird. I was like, god does not even feel like he\u2019s in here.

I\u2019ve been watching you\n(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it\u2019s true)\nCouldn\u2019t fight to save your lif\u0435 but you look so cool\nCamo jacket robbing corner stores\nHard odds to b\u0435at when you\u2019re on all fours\nGood men die too so I\u2019d rather be with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI owe you a black eye and two kisses\nTell me when you wanna come and get em\nI only want him if he says it first to me\nI wanna \u2026 him in the back of his mom\u2019s Mercury\nHe looks like he works with his hands\nAnd smells like Marlboro reds\nIt makes me so \u2026 and I can\u2019t get enough of it\n\nSomething\u2019s been feeling weird lately\nThere\u2019s just something about you, baby\nMaybe I\u2019ll just be crazy\nAnd piss him off \u2018til he hates me\n(Yeah right, he fucking loves me)\nLow slung bad bitch, baby come and get you some\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you read my mind? I\u2019ve been watching you\nCouldn\u2019t fight to save your life but you look so cool\n(You know it, you know it, you know)\nCamo jacket robbing corner stores\nHard odds to beat when you\u2019re on all fours\nGood men die too so I\u2019d rather be with you\nYou might also likeOh, I\u2019d rather be with you\nOh, I\u2019d rather be with you\n'Cause good men die too so I\u2019d rather be with you10Embed"

This song is from Springsteen\u2019s album Nebraska, which shares not just geographic but thematic elements with Preacher\u2019s Daughter. Cain\u2019s music has often been compared to Springsteen\u2019s; both artists\u2019 work interrogate an idealized and unachievable American identity. The titular song off Springsteen\u2019s album details the real-life serial killings of Charles Starkweather and his female accomplice. Springsteen also explores intergenerational trauma on the album, and \u201cReason to Believe,\u201d in particular, explores the persistence of faith in the face of hardship. It may also be referencing his famous song \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town,\u201d in which he explores American cultural alienation."

She confronts the darkness.\n\nThe song name is inspired from Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy [specifically Dante\u2019s Inferno] Ptolemea, named after Ptolemy, is a circle of Hell in which the traitorous reside. Maybe this is a reference to Ethel abandoning her family and faith \u2013 only to be met with a wrath far worse."

              "tw // grooming & gaslighting\n\nI was listening to this song with a friend who had recently been a victim of grooming, when we got to this part she told me (under a heavy layer of irony) that she had \u201cheard this before.\u201d\n\nif it feels good, then it can\u2019t leave lasting physical, psychological, emotional, mental damage and trauma, right?\n\nEthel is being gaslighted and taken advantage of, she\u2019s being told that since sex is pleasurable, she should enjoy it and not think about how the circumstances she\u2019s in \u2013 how messed up and dangerous (physically and psychologically) it is to be pimped like she is, how Isaac is taking advantage of her, how he uses her and throws her away because in the end, she doesn\u2019t matter to him, and the marks or \u201ccrosses\u201d that it could leave on her body & psyche.\n\nDepending on the groomer, \u201cif it feels good, then it can\u2019t be bad\u201d can be said in a reassuring or dismissive tone, to deceive the victim or the groomer themselves, but either way the message is the same: \u201cThose thoughts are irrational. You\u2019re overthinking. Enjoy it for what it can be.\u201d"
