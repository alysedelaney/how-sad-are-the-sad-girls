            "plain": "Released as the second single of The Big Freeze (2019), \u201cValue Inn\u201d is about retreating to a cheap hotel to inflict self-harm\".\n\nThe song references her Dermatillomania, a self-harm disorder. Laura has explained the meaning of the song:\n\nThat song\u2019s basically about this cycle of self-harm that I\u2019ve been in silently for a really long, long, long time, and also is just about not taking care of yourself, or being kind or gentle because you don\u2019t know how. And also, that song\u2019s pretty much about being the mediator, people-pleaser, codependent person that\u2019s in my family, like, \u201cI gotta hold all this shit together, so I\u2019m never going to talk about how fucked up I am,\u201d and then like I\u2019m falling apart in the meantime (laughs). So yeah, that\u2019s also what that\u2019s about. Yeah, a lot of heavy shit, but again, this was kind of like a reckoning for me. It was like, a little bit of a manifesto when I was writing it, like, \u201cIf I start talking about this, maybe this will be the step towards change that I am currently for real working on.\u201d\n\nLaura has also said:\n\n\u201cValue Inn\u201d was the most important song for me. The way that it came out [musically] is exactly what writing that song felt like."

                  "plain": "Released as the second single of The Big Freeze (2019), \u201cValue Inn\u201d is about retreating to a cheap hotel to inflict self-harm\".\n\nThe song references her Dermatillomania, a self-harm disorder. Laura has explained the meaning of the song:\n\nThat song\u2019s basically about this cycle of self-harm that I\u2019ve been in silently for a really long, long, long time, and also is just about not taking care of yourself, or being kind or gentle because you don\u2019t know how. And also, that song\u2019s pretty much about being the mediator, people-pleaser, codependent person that\u2019s in my family, like, \u201cI gotta hold all this shit together, so I\u2019m never going to talk about how fucked up I am,\u201d and then like I\u2019m falling apart in the meantime (laughs). So yeah, that\u2019s also what that\u2019s about. Yeah, a lot of heavy shit, but again, this was kind of like a reckoning for me. It was like, a little bit of a manifesto when I was writing it, like, \u201cIf I start talking about this, maybe this will be the step towards change that I am currently for real working on.\u201d\n\nLaura has also said:\n\n\u201cValue Inn\u201d was the most important song for me. The way that it came out [musically] is exactly what writing that song felt like."

        "lyrics": "The Move Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThese two back teeth are ground meat\nI've barely slept this week\nBut you're lovely in the morning, oh\nReminding me why I should be sorry\nSay, \"I love your brain\nBut I hate it when it pushes me away.\"\nWell, it's been down and now, you're finally finding out\nThat I'm not supposed to get better\nBut I said I won't be quite like this forever\n'Cause I'm a liar and a thief\n[Bridge]\nWell, there's an easy way to wind your watch\nCome here and take it off\nI'll keep it safely in the back where I can clean it\nI mean it, there is no time like the present\nOr something just as stupid\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll tell you I can make you happy\nI can make you coffee when I wake up\nIf you haven't made some already\nThere's a ticking, but it's subtle\nAnd you barely even notice\nBut you'll know it when your eyes, they start to focus\nTill then I'm around in a hot room by myself\nOrganizing all the ways\nThat I could take all of the things you love away\nSo I put it on you, 'cause it's easier to do\nI watch you smoke until you know me\n'Til you're dizzy and you're lonely\n\n[Outro]\nMake the move\nI am leaving it up to you\nMake the move\nI am leaving it up to you\nOh, make the move\nI am leaving it up to youYou might also likeEmbed"

            "plain": "A FEW WORDS ABOUT JEFF & LAURA COVERING A FEW SONGS BY NEIL YOUNG\n\nJEFF: Laura and I have known each other since we were teenagers skankin\u2019 our buns off in the same VFW halls, church basements and high school auditoriums sorry. We\u2019ve played in each others\u2019 bands on-and-off throughout this marvelous millenium and under the immense stress of the music industry and oh boy, let\u2019s not forget these difficult times, our friendship has not collapsed. It is strong, like a sicky thicky beam of steel!\n\nLAURA: May I interject here and state for the record that I did not skank? I was merely a spectator. But I will agree that our friendship began strong and it REMAINS very strong.\n\nJEFF: Much like our friendship, Neil Young\u2019s songs have existed for a long time \u2013 some would argue, they\u2019ve existed for even longer. For a while, I knew I was supposed to like Neil Young but a lot of the \u201cstandards\u201d admittedly are not for me*. Eventually I asked Laura and her husband Mike to get me started somewhere, and months later, I would spend nights traveling alone on tour with After The Gold Rush on repeat in my headphones, simultaneously allowing me to feel grounded and as if I was floating away. As I dove deeper into his catalog, more and more records of his would bookend my days \u2013 giving my band buds something chill to sleep to on a morning drive or slowing me down at night as I space out in front of my record player.\n\nLAURA: I\u2019m so glad Jeff finally got sucked in. For me, Neil Young was playing in my house for as long as I can remember. My favorite record being \u201cComes A Time\u201d which I think for sure influenced my love of harmonizing. But it\u2019s kind of a hard task to get someone to love something as much as you do when it\u2019s just this thing you\u2019ve always known and appreciated. I\u2019m happy it worked!\n\nJEFF: Seth from Polyvinyl has joked that I like \u201csad Neil\u201d and I have claimed on multiple occasions that \u201cI hate it when Neil rocks.\u201d But I don\u2019t. I love it when he does anything, because no matter what the project is it always feels honest and pure. He is a famous-as-fuck songwriter that could sell out a basketball arena at the drop of a hat even though he\u2019s always sticking his middle fingers up at the world, his audience included. That\u2019s the kinda shit we\u2019re into.\n\nLAURA: I think it\u2019s just so different when he rocks. I get that the two are such opposite ends of the spectrum but they still have the same underlying emotional content. I feel like Jeff and myself, as songwriters who grew up in punk rock, have a similar thing, where you can be very sweet and beautiful, and then at times, kind of ugly and heavier, but it\u2019s always the same voice and the same intention at the end of the day.\n\nJEFF: Laura and I have been talking about doing a few EPs of Neil Young covers for years. It\u2019s an excuse to have fun making music together and we both like fun and music in case you missed it. It\u2019s also nice to hang out and create (sorry) instead of just talking about \u201coh my god did you hear what this stupid dipshit did on tour? I hope their band takes us out.\u201d We finally both had time away from the road this summer, Laura heroically made the trip down to my apartment in Brooklyn a few times and we\u2019d feverishly lay down a bunch of tracks. I like hearing Laura play guitar and she convinced me to sing quieter than I ever have. We had a few friends fill in some details and we quickly had this EP you\u2019re listening to. I hope it\u2019s not too long before we make another!\n\n\nyes I understand this EP starts with two title tracks."

During dinner, Stephen\u2019s dislike towards Django grows increasingly apparent due to the fact that he is a free man and is free to ride a horse alongside white men. As the senior house slave he has the luxury of being the authority over the other slaves but his intellect, like that of all slaves, is grossly underestimated by his owner. This is a kind of freedom of itself because it affords Stephen the opportunity to watch and see what is really going on at the dinner table. He becomes suspicious of Django and Broomhilda. In the kitchen, he taunts Broomhilda. Later, he informs Candie that Django and Schultz are more interested in Broomhilda than purchasing a mandingo.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel L.

Oh\n\nDon't tire of\nDon't tire of me yet\n\nI could lie and say to you that this would soon be over\nI could lie and say I knew, that I'd be waking up tomorrow\n\nYou came with your faith unshaken\nUnabashed, oh my darling, you're amazing\nWith your hands so cold and full of callouses\n\nI could lie and say to you that this would soon be over\nI could lie and say I knew, where we'd be waking up tomorrow\nI could make a little shape for us to stay\nUntil we have to go away again\nThe wait is just a little longerYou might also likeEmbed"
