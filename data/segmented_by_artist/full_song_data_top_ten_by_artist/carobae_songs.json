        "lyrics": "King Arthur: Book X LyricsSoon as the rising Sun's victorious Light\nHad Scal'd, and pass'd the gloomy Mounds of Night.\nThe British Partys who to beat the Road\nAnd gain Intelligence were sent abroad,\nReturning to the Camp did Tydings bring,\nThat as Commanded by the Gallic King\nHis Cavalry advanc'd at distance lay,\nOff from the Foot, and Arbel did obey.\nClotar himself did with the Foot remain,\nWhich lay encamp'd on rich Lutetia's Plain.\nThen did King Arthur let his Captains know\nThat he the Horse would Lead and Charge the Foe,\nCommanding that the Foot with utmost speed\nShould onward march to share the glorious Deed.\nGreat Arthur with Heroic Ardor warm'd\nHis Weapons took and for the Battel Arm'd.\nRound his strong Legs he made his Pieces fast\nWith Silver Studds, and Golden Buttons grac'd.\nThen did he lace his polish'd Helmet on\nWhich with distinguish'd wondrous brightness shone.\nA noble Plume did his high Crest adorn,\nFair as the Morning Star, or as the Morn.\nA Purple Scarf, like mild Aurora's pride,\nEnrich'd with Golden Tassels grac'd his Side.\nNext, like the Moon at full, his spacious Shield\nBlaz'd on his Arm and dazled all the Field.\nAs Forges full of melted Oar by night\nAppear at distance to the Travellers sight,\nWhere brawny Smith besmear'd with Smoke and Sweat.\nFor Ships of War unweildy Anchors beat.\nSo did the Warriour's Burnish'd Buckler glow,\nAnd such fierce Light did from the Metal flow.\nHis mighty Fauchion which of all the Field,\nTwo of the strongest Chiefs could scarcely weild,\nWhose fatal Edge so many Heros felt,\nHung down suspended in his glorious Belt.\nThen his long Spear he took which in his hand\nWhen firmly grip'd shook like an Osier wand.\nAs when a Cyclops with his pondrous Sledge\nOn the hard Anvil strikes a flaming Wedge,\nWhen he designs the malleable mass\nShall into some Capacious Caldron pass,\nThe fiery Dust at every blow that flys\nAnd glaring Light vex the Spectator's Eyes.\nThe Briton's Arms shone thus excessive bright,\nDarted keen Glances and uneasy Light,\nAnd tho' his Glory pleas'd, it pain'd the Sight.\nWhile thus the Monarch Arm'd, his noble Steed\nSprung from Britannic mixt with Thracian Breed,\nPraunc'd in the Negro's hand, and tost around\nHis generous Foam that Whiten'd all the ground.\nIn his hot Mouth he champt the Golden Bit,\nAnd paw'd the Vally with his thund'ring Feet.\nThe King advanc'd, and in his Martial Heat\nMounting the Steed, and leaping cross the Seat\nSuch was the clanking of his Arms as made,\nBy the surprize his starting Friends affraid.\nThe fiery Beast Impatient of the Rein,\nCurveted, Bounc'd, and Bounded o'er the Plain.\nThe Eagle scarcely flew so swift and strong,\nWhen she to Heav'n, as ancient Poets sung,\nFrom \u00c6tna's Caves, and Vulcan's fiery Store\nHot Thunderbolts, and vengeful Light'ning bore.\nThus the swift Courser past, and thro' the Air\nDid on his back the glorious Tempest bear.\nNext Osor General of the British Horse\nIn order follow'd, Arthur's rapid Course.\nThen Noble Clovis warm with martial Heat\nAdvanc'd his great Atchievements to repeat.\nNow all the Squadrons from the Camp were pour'd,\nAll bold in Arms and to the Field inur'd.\n\nThe Trumpet's cheerful Voice the Region fills,\nRedoubled by the Rocks and ecchoing Hills.\nThe Heav'ns with Arms and war-like noise resound,\nAnd fiery Coursers shake the trembling Ground.\nThick Clouds of Smoke and Foam around e'm fly,\nAnd rising Fogs of Dust obscure the Sky.\nSoon Albion's Monarch with his speedy Course\nCame within prospect of King Clotar's Horse.\nThe numerous Squadrons rang'd in Battel stood,\nAnd look'd at distance like an Iron Wood.\nAs when a gathering Tempest do's arise\nWith sullen Brow, and slowly mounts the Skys,\nThe Stygian Vapours from their Caves repair\nTo the black Rendezvous amidst the Air.\nTh' embattled Clouds in gloomy Throngs ascend,\nAnd cross the Sky their dreadful Front extend.\nSo thick the Franks appear'd along the Plain,\nReady th' invading Briton to sustain.\nA Grove of Lances o'er the Region spreads,\nWith Bucklers intermixt and burnish'd Heads.\nAs when some famous Master Engineer,\nSuch as great Ricar and Becano are,\nA Triumph for some Conqueror do's prepare.\nBright Rockets, Serpents, Stars of Nitre rise,\nAnd mingling Fires Inlighten all the Skys.\nProud Pyramids aloft to Heav'n aspire\nAdorn'd with Wreathing Flames, and Laurels all of Fire.\nSo now the Air shone bright with Helms and Spears,\nWith Corslets, Shields, and plated Cuirassiers.\nArbel who ne'er was Conscious yet of fear,\nSoon as he saw the British Troops appear.\nPleas'd with th' important Danger of the day\nResolv'd th' advancing Briton's Course to stay;\nAnd as a prudent Gen'ral did prepare\nHis numerous Squadrons to receive the War.\nHe rode thro' all the Regiments and Ranks\nTo animate and cheer th' Embattled Franks.\nThen the great Leader in the Center stood,\nAnd to the Troops around him cry'd aloud,\nOn you, brave Men, Your Prince has still rely'd,\nSure of your Faith and Courage often try'd.\nWhat mighty Warriours have you overcome?\nWhat Captive Princes brought in Triumph home?\nWhat wonders have your Arms in Battel done,\nWhat wealthy Spoils from vanquish'd Nations won?\nYou've by the glorious Fields which you have fought,\nNot only kept what your great Fathers got,\nBut have by humbling Neighb'ring Monarchs Pride,\nExtended Gallia's Empire far and wide.\nYou have the Power of distant Kingdoms broke,\nAnd on their Necks impos'd the Gallic Yoke.\nYou have your martial fame and terror spred,\nAnd all Europa's Youth your Ensigns dread.\nWhat Heros ever could your Arms resist?\nWhen have your Squadrons fought, and Conquest mist?\nArthur, 'tis true, did once some Troops defeat,\nBut must not think his Vict'ry to repeat.\nThe plying Infantry by giving Way,\nThe great Disorder caus'd that lost the Day.\nYou never were engag'd, you ne'er could show\nThe Fire with which you us'd to Charge the Foe.\nClotar on you his Cavalry relys,\nAnd by your Arms the British Power defys.\n'Tis by the Cavalry the Franks have done\nTheir mighty Deeds, and gain'd their chief Renown.\nYour Valour must determine Gallia's Fate,\nYou are the Bulwark, that protects her State.\nWho can withstand, brave Men, the fatal Sword\nOf Vet'ran Troops to Conquest long inur'd?\nWhat Danger is so great, what Task so hard\nThat can the Triumphs of such Troops retard?\n\nScarce had he ended when his Courser's Flanks\nThe Briton gor'd, and Sprung amidst the Ranks.\nHis first projected Spear Bermondo slew,\nPiercing his Cuirass, Shield, and Body thro':\nDrunk with the Wound which inwardly did bleed\nThe giddy Frank sat tottering on his Steed.\nThe Courser's Reins fell from his feeble hand,\nThen down he headlong fell, and prest the Sand.\nNext to the sight strong Osbal did advance,\nBut in his Breast receiv'd the Briton's Lance.\nAs Thunder struck from Heav'n, the mighty Gaul\nFell down, and shook the Vally with his fall.\nThe Conq'ring Briton o'er his Body rode,\nAnd deep into the Sand his reeking Entrails trod.\nStout Monlac next stood in the Briton's way,\nAnd proudly hop'd the Victor's Course to stay.\nThro' his right Eye the Monarch's Weapon past,\nAnd pierc'd his Skull which steel in vain encas'd.\nHe tumbled from his Seat, and on the ground\nHe felt his Life departing from his Wound.\n\nThen by Garontes cast a mighty Spear\nCut thro' the downy Bosom of the Air:\nAgainst the Conquering King it took it's Course,\nBut in his Buckler spent it's dying Force.\nGarontes wheeling off had strait retir'd,\nBut that the King with Indignation fir'd,\nFlew to the Charge, and with an oblique stroke\nHis mighty Fauchion thro' the Helmet broke.\nHe did his Mouth from Ear to Ear divide,\nAnd from the Wound gush'd out a reeking Tyde.\nHis sever'd Jaw depending ghastly show'd,\nAnd from his Throat he Cough'd up Teeth and Blood.\nHe fell, and while he lay in torturing Pain,\nHot Coursers trod to Mire his Head and Brain.\nOnvil advanc'd the Briton to repel,\nBut on his Crest the mighty Fauchion fell.\nThe noble stroke did the strong Captain stun,\nWho dropt his Sword, and Shield, and in a Swoon,\nA while lay sensless on his Courser's Main,\nThen fell, and lay stretcht out amidst the Slain.\nMartel, who still the hottest Battel sought,\nAnd from the Combate frequent Laurels brought,\nAdvanc'd the Monarch's progress to arrest,\nAnd hurl'd his massy Spear against his Breast.\nOn Arthur's temper'd Shield the Weapon broke,\nIn pieces flew, and lost the furious stroke.\nThe King incens'd, flew on t'ingage the Foe,\nAnd at his Neck discharg'd a mighty Blow.\nOff leap'd the Head, and murm'ring flew away,\nThen gasping in the Dust, and twinkling lay.\nSo swiftly did the sev'ring Fauchion go,\nSo quick, so strong, so suddain was the Blow,\nThat still the Trunk, tho' of the Head depriv'd,\nPreserv'd its Seat, and scarce the loss perceiv'd:\nA while a ghastly Prospect there it staid,\nAnd from the Neck the bloody Fountains play'd,\nWhich high into the Air their Purple Streams convey'd,\nThen down it tumbled, and amidst the Dead,\nLay at a distance from the sever'd Head.\nNext Oroban who grew in Battel bold,\nBecause the Augur when consulted told,\nThat from the War he should Victorious come,\nAnd chase from Gallia's Coast the Britons home;\nOppos'd the King, but th' unexpected Steel\nThe wounded Frank did in his Bosom feel.\nApproaching Fate he did in vain resist,\nDying he fell, and curst the lying Priest.\n\nThe Monarch then sprang forward to Assail,\nLansac, confiding in his Coat of Mail.\nThe Fauchion thro' the Coat soon passage found,\nHis Shoulder cleft, and made a ghastly Wound.\nThe fainting Gaul fell headlong from his seat\nAnd lay extended at the Courser's feet.\nThen thus the Pious King the Frank bespoke,\nAt last thy Crimes have met th' avenging stroke.\nHow many Christians has thy Savage hand\nRack'd and destroy'd, pleas'd with thy Lord's Command?\nNo Torments, no Destruction could asswage\nThy thirst of Blood, and Persecuting Rage.\nThink on the Arts thy Malice did invent,\nT'afflict the Poor, and vex the Innocent.\nNow thou must suffer for th' atrocious Guilt,\nFor all the Blood thy impious hand has spilt.\nThen his bright Spear he thro' his Body thrust,\nSpur'd on his Steed, and crush'd him in the Dust.\n\nTorbet stood next, distinguish'd from the rest\nBoth by his gaudy Arms, and Priestly Vest.\nBut when he saw th' advancing Conqueror near,\nAnd ready to discharge his massy Spear,\nHe from th' Invader turn'd his Courser's head,\nAnd from the dreadful danger would have fled.\nBut then desparing to escape by Flight,\nAnd yet affraid to undertake the Fight,\nTrembling and Pale with fear himself he threw\nAt Arthur's Feet, and thus for Life did sue.\nPity, great Prince, as well as Courage show,\nAnd turn from Torbet's head your fatal Blow.\nMy Death alass can no Applauses move,\nNor can my worthless Life e'er Dang'rous prove.\nA Priest I am, but never did perswade\nWith Fire and Sword the Christians to invade.\nI ne'er did Clotar's Cruelty Commend,\nBut thought such Deeds Heav'n's Vengeance would attend.\nI still Compassion to the Sufferers shew'd,\nAnd ne'er my hands in Christian blood embru'd.\nHe said. The King the trembling Coward left\nBy his own Fears almost of Life bereft.\n\nThen Bramar trusting to his mighty Force\nCame boldly on t'oppose the Monarch's Course.\nProudly he rein'd his generous, milk-white Steed\nAs Thracian bold, swift as Iberian Breed.\nThe Briton's Spear aim'd at his shining Crest,\nMissing the Rider struck the prauncing Beast,\nAnd entring deep lay buried in his Chest.\nHe on his hinder Feet himself did rear,\nAnd with the foremost paw'd, and beat the Air;\nThen on the ground he fell, and with his fall\nThe groaning Courser crush'd the war-like Gaul.\nArthur advanc'd, and gave the fatal Wound;\nThe Weapon fixt the Body to the ground.\nAt Dagbert next, and Marodel he flew,\nThe first his Spear, the last his Fauchion slew:\nThis split the Brain, that with a furious stroke\nThe Warriour's Ankle-bone to Splinters broke.\nThen Cossan, Aldar, Molan, Sarabel,\nAranda, Clobar, and Elviran fell.\nAs when loud Boreas blows his stiffest Gales,\nTo swell some War-like Ship's expanded Sails,\nDriv'n with the furious Wind the Vessel braves\nThe foaming Troops, and thick embattled Waves.\nO'er Billows thronging Heads the Victor rides,\nCuts thro', and all the watry Host divides.\nWith equal Force the Valiant Briton flew\nAmidst the Ranks, and charg'd as swiftly thro'.\n\nOsor mean time broke thro' th' opposing Franks,\nAnd bravely plung'd amidst the thickest Ranks.\nGreat Shabron's Head his fatal Fauchion cleft,\nAnd on the ground th' expiring Pagan left.\nT'engage the Briton Rimon did advance;\nBut in his Buckler broke th' unprosperous Lance.\nOsor incens'd advanc'd to Charge the Foe,\nPois'd his long Spear and pierc'd his Body thro'.\nThe Pagan sinking backward lost the Rein,\nThe affrighted steed ran wild across the Plain\nAnd dropt the dying Frank amidst the Slain.\nNext the brave Warriour did his Javelin throw\nAt Ulna's Breast, which tho' it mist the Foe,\nThe glittering point his Steed's right Eye-ball past,\nAnd stuck within the bloody Orbit fast.\nHigh in the Air he rose, then to the ground\nHe backward fell, expiring with the wound.\nStruck Breathless with the Fall, the noble Frank\nLay with his Shoulders on the Courser's Flank.\nQuick to the ground the Briton from his Seat\nWith ardor leap'd, his Conquest to compleat.\nHe laid his left Hand on the Warriour's Crest,\nAnd with his right Hand stab'd him in the Breast.\n\nThen Andolan of Ammon's noble Line\nBorn on the flowry Banks of Silver Sein,\nSpur'd his hot Steed, and griping fast his Spear,\nRan at the Briton with a full Career.\nIllustrious Osor ne'er to fear inur'd,\nT'engage the Frank his Courser onward spur'd.\nThen with a mighty shock the Coursers met\nDismounting both the Riders from their Seat.\nSo when two Ships their Contest to decide\nIn rude Rencounters meet upon the Tide,\nNo more the Sailors can their Decks maintain,\nBut with the Shock are forc'd into the Main.\nTheir feet recover'd, soon the Champions drew\nTheir flashing Blades, and to the Combate flew.\nForwards stretcht out they did their Bodys bend,\nAnd with uplifted Shields their Heads defend.\nVast strokes were now discharg'd on either side,\nStrokes that with ease would unarm'd Limbs divide.\nTheir Armour was deform'd with numerous dints,\nAnd their bruis'd Bucklers shew'd the Fauchions prints.\nFor Conquest long the Captains did contend,\nAnd in vast strokes their Martial Vigour spend.\nStill both the Combatants maintain'd their ground,\nNeither had given, nor yet receiv'd a Wound.\nAt last their Strength with equal honour spent,\nTo end the noble Combate both consent.\nThe valiant Chiefs in friendly manner part,\nPraising each other's Strength, each other's Art.\nThe generous Briton to the Gallic Lord\nDid for a present give a famous Sword.\nThe Haft an Agate was from India brought,\nWhere inlaid Trees, and Birds by Nature wrought\nAppear'd distinct and fair, as Ants and Bees\nKill'd and Entomb'd in drops from Amber Trees.\nWith their best Skill Iberian Masters made\nOf purest temper'd Steel the faithful Blade.\nThe ample Scabbard which the Sword did hold,\nShone bright with glitt'ring Gems and Studs of Gold.\nThis Sword Nazaleod from rich Colmar won,\nWhen he the Saxon slew with great renown,\nAnd his rich Spoils midst loud Applauses brought\nFrom the fam'd Battel at Gallena fought:\nThe Sword Nazaleod to great Osor gave\nWhose Arms did once his Life in Battel save.\n\nThe noble Frank a Saddle did present\nGlorious with Gems, with Work magnificent.\nThe Pummel was an Ivory Lyon's Head\nThat fiercly grin'd, as those in Lybia bred.\nThe Seat rich Crimson Velvet cover'd o'er,\nLike that exported from Liguria's Shore.\nTh' embroader'd Skirts were all with Gold besmear'd,\nWhere Figures wrought with curious Art appear'd.\nA Leopard's Skin th' appending Housing was\nFrom Afric brought, and grac'd with Silver Paws.\n\nElsewhere brave Clovis did the Foe pursue,\nAnd first his massy Spear at Ortan threw.\nThe temper'd Shield could not it's Force Arrest,\nIt pass'd the Plys and pierc'd the Warriour's Breast.\nThe secret Springs of Life the Weapon found,\nAnd broke them open with a fatal Wound.\nThe Spear fixt in his Breast, some time he hung,\nAnd with his left hand to the Saddle clung,\nBut with his Right held fast the Courser's Main\nAnd thus a while his Body did sustain.\nBut Death unstrung his Nerves, and loos'd his hold,\nThen in the Sand th' expiring Captain roll'd.\nThen with his Battel Ax great Clovis flew\nAt Maronac, and cleft his Shoulder thro'.\nDown on the Ground the Arm dis-joynted dropt,\nAs a great Limb falls from a Poplar lopt.\nStrait the dismember'd Frank, a fearful Sight,\nWheel'd off in vain to save his Life by Flight.\nWarm streams flew out from every sever'd vein\nAnd markt with tracks of Blood the Dusty Plain.\nDefrauded of his Strength the feeble Gaul\nAt last did headlong from his Courser fall.\nCold Death forbad his lab'ring Heart to beat,\nAnd in his blood supprest the vital Heat.\nThen Carobel who had advanc'd his name\nBy learned Arts, and Skill in Nature's Fame,\nBold too in Arms, and to the Camp inur'd,\nFell in Lutetia's fields by Clovis Sword:\nThro' Helm and Skull the Fauchion passage found,\nCleft thro' the Brain, and ruin'd with the Wound\nThe curious Imag'ry by Fancy wrought,\nAll Mem'ry's Cells, and all the Moulds of Thought.\nNext Alloman lay dead, Lugdunum's Pride,\nAnd beauteous Ormal stretcht out by his Side.\n\nCapellan also signaliz'd his Arms,\nAnd boldly prest amidst the Gallic Swarms.\nHe slew at Lucan with a full Career,\nAnd thro' his Bosom past his fatal Spear.\nHis second Fromel kill'd, the next he threw\nYoung Lamar pierc'd, the next Obella slew.\nThen his Projected Dart transfixt the Head\nOf Grutar's Steed, which on the field lay dead.\nAcross the Beast on which before he rode\nGhastly with Gore and Dust the Warriour strode\nWith his strong Arm he did his Spear protend,\nAnd with his burnish'd Shield his Head defend.\nA while he strove, and bravely kept his ground,\nTill the fierce Briton's Spear it's passage found\nThro' Helm and Head, and then with Death opprest\nHe fell, and lay across th' extended Beast.\n\nWhile Valiant Clovis so much Honour won,\nElsewhere like Wonders were by Lucius done.\nFirst in his way by luckless Fortune stood,\nYoung Medolan of Trabor's noble Blood.\nThe Javelin thro' his Belly made it's way,\nAnd in his wounded Entrails buried lay.\nThe Youth, so much he was to Arms inclin'd,\nLeft unenjoy'd his beauteous Bride behind;\nHe's now embrac'd by Death' s unwelcom Arms,\nAnd to another quits her Maiden Charms.\nBrave Arcan burning with a Martial Flame,\nTo aid his wounded Brother swiftly came;\nBut felt the Briton's Steel within his Veins,\nWhich thro' his Armour pierc'd the Warriour's Reins.\nUpon his Seat he could no longer stay\nBut fell, and cross his dying Brother lay.\nTheir mournful Friends look'd on, but were afraid,\nSo great the Peril was, to give them Aid.\nSo when a Lyon roaming o'er the Lawns,\nDescrys the Thicket where her tender Fawns\nThe Doe as she believ'd did safely lay,\nIn do's he leap, and tear the panting Prey\nThe Doe at distance do's their Fate bewail,\nBut dares not come the Murd'rer to Assail.\nWhile Valiant Lucius such destruction made,\nAgainst the Chief advanc'd a strong Brigade;\nAnd opening to the Right and Left, the Foes\nOn every side the Leader did enclose.\nThe noble Briton did himself defend,\nWhile Clouds of Spears from every part they send.\nThe missive War upon his Buckler rung,\nAnd showers of fruitless Deaths around him sung.\nSo when fierce Dogs and clam'rous Swains surround\nA mighty Boar in neighb'ring Mountains found;\nHis Bristles high erected on his Back,\nThe raging Beast withstands the Foes attack:\nHe whets his dreadful Tusks, and from afar\nHe foams, and flourishes the Ivory War.\nThe cautious Huntsmen at a distance rage,\nCast all their Darts, but dare not close engage.\nAt last the Briton from an unknown Spear,\nReceiv'd a painful Wound beneath the Ear.\nThe striving Blood did thro' his Armour spout\nThe Franks observing gave a mighty shout.\nThus wounded and opprest, the British Chief\nCall'd to his Friends aloud to bring Relief.\nIt chanc'd that mighty Trelon then was near,\nWho to his Squadron cry'd, the Voice I hear\nIs Lucius, who encircled with the Foe,\nContends in vain to cut his passage thro'.\nTo bring him off we'll force the Gallic Ranks.\nHe said, and strait he spur'd his Courser's Flanks,\nAnd shaking in his hand his glitt'ring Lance,\nTo Charge the Franks with Fury did advance.\nThe Franks disperst when Trelon first appear'd,\nSo much they all his famous Courage fear'd.\nSo when fierce Wolves have seiz'd a fainting Deer,\nBut newly wounded by the Huntsman's Spear.\nWith reeking Blood they feast their hungry Jaws,\nAnd the warm Entrails pant beneath their Paws.\nBut if a Lyon comes, the awful Sight\nDo's from their Prey the prowling Race affright.\nThen his bright Spear with Fury cast betwixt\nThe Flank and Chest, great Tolna's Steed transfixt.\nThe generous Beast beneath the Rider fell:\nTolna th' invading Tempest to repel,\nSpringing with Vigour from the Courser's back,\nAdvanc'd on foot great Trelon to attack.\nAnd that the Briton's Fury might be stay'd,\nHis Left Hand on the Courser's Reins he laid,\nAnd held his flaming Fauchion in the Right,\nResolving thus he would maintain the Fight.\nThe Britons Steed that Swords and Spears disdain'd,\nWith Indignation foam'd to be restrain'd:\nTrelon enrag'd, divided at a blow\nHis Arm, which dropt and let the Courser go.\nThe generous Steed finding the Rein releast,\nSprang forth, and struck stout Tolna in the Breast,\nWho breathless fell, with endless Night opprest.\n\nMean time, at distance Arbel bravely fought,\nAnd wondrous Fame by great Atchievements sought.\nHis Courage, Strength, and Conduct often try'd\nMade all the Gallic Youth in him confide\nAs their Chief Champion, and their surest guide.\nHe spur'd his fiery Steed, and forwards sprung\nAmidst the Troops, and broke th' opposing Throng.\nBrave Gomar first his fury did withstand,\nBut while to cast his Spear he rais'd his hand,\nThe Frank's bright Lance between his Armour's joynt\nBeneath his Arm-pit past its glitt'ring point.\nDeep in his breathing Lungs the Weapon lay\nThe Neustrian's fell, and saw no more the Day.\nCoril advanc'd to undertake the Fight,\nAnd threw his Weapon with prodigious might.\nThe Frank inclin'd his head, and heard the Spear\nAim'd at his Crest pass singing by his Ear.\nThen did his Dart against the Briton fly,\nAnd wounded thro' the Plate his brawny Thigh.\nA bloody Stream gush'd from the painful wound,\nAnd flowing down his Armour stain'd the ground.\nOn did th' insulting Frank with fury fly,\nAnd eager to compleat the Victory.\nOn high his dreadful Battel-Axe did heave,\nHoping in two the Briton's head to cleave.\nBut as it fell, the Courser rose, and took\nBetween his Ears the Champions furious stroke.\nThe Steel sunk thro' his Brain the staggering Beast\nFell, and his weight the wounded Rider prest.\nBold Malgo brought his Squadron up, and freed\nThe groaning Briton from the unweildy steed.\nThey drew by force the Hero from the Field,\nThen bore him off laid on a spacious Shield.\nSo when a Flag Ship is by Foes o'erborn,\nUnmasted, and with Cannon's Thunder torn,\nFrom the hot Fight attending Frigates pull\nAnd Tow along the maim'd, disabled Hull.\n\nMean time the Briton with his reeking Blade\nHad his swift passage to the Quarter made,\nWhere Arbel's Sword destroy'd, and strew'd around\nWith Riders and their Steeds th' encumber'd ground\nAs when a Lyon from a Mountain's side\nHas in the Vale a lowing Herd descry'd,\nHe stands, and turns his furious Eyes about,\nThe strongest, sowrest Bull to single out,\nOne worthy of his Rage, by all the Herd\nObey'd as Lord, and by each Rival fear'd:\nThen having fixt his choice aloud he roars,\nProclaims the War, and to the Combate scowrs.\nSo Arthur keeping Arbel in his Eye,\nDid to the sight with dreadful fury fly.\nThe Gaul observ'd the Monarch from afar,\nAnd for the Combate did himself prepare.\nHigh on his Steed the might Warriour sate,\nProud of his Strength, and fearless of his Fate.\nLike a great Pine o'ershadowing all the Wood,\nOr ancient Poplar reering by the Flood\nHis lofty head, the towring Pagan stood.\nWell-pleas'd to undertake the noble Fight\nHe did aloud to Arms the King invite.\nWho on his fiery Steed advancing near,\nProjected thro' the Air his pondrous Spear.\nThe Frank to make his weapon's message vain\nStoop'd down, and lay upon his Courser's Main.\nTh' eluded Weapon o'er his Shoulder flew,\nAnd at great distance Caumont's Courser slew.\nThen did the Frank employing all his Strength\nDischarge his Spear of formidable Length,\nHissing along the Air, the Weapon went,\nBut in the Hero's Shield its fury spent.\nHis second Spear the Pious Briton threw\nWhich like a flash of Lightning swiftly flew.\nThe wheeling Frank could not the Steel evade\nWhich thro' his Shield and Thigh its passage made;\nWhence deep it sunk within the Courser's Chest,\nAnd fixt the Rider to the wounded Beast.\nFrom both their sever'd veins the reeking Blood\nGush'd out, and mingled in one Common Flood.\nThen down they fell and prest the slipp'ry plain,\nThe Rider wounded, and the Courser slain.\nThe King with martial Ardor to the ground\nLeap'd from his Steed to give the fatal wound.\nHis dreadful Fauchion glittering in his hand\nHe o'er the vanquish'd Frank did threatning stand.\nThe Frank in Anguish, Horrour, and Despair,\nDid on the high rais'd Weapon wildly stare.\nThen thus the Pious Prince bespoke the Gaul,\nThink on thy Barb'rous Deeds, remember all\nThe Fatherless and Widdows thou hast made,\nAnd Christian Martyrs to the Flames convey'd.\nWhat numbers has thy single hand destroy'd?\nWhat numbers more the Troops by thee Employ'd?\nThese Impious Deeds thou bloody Instrument\nOf Clotar's Cruelty at last Repent.\n\nThe Frank reply'd. No Sorrow can I own\nFor my just anger to the Christians shown.\nCan he impiety to me object,\nWho do's the Worship of the Gods neglect?\nWhose sacrilegious hands their Temples raze\nDestroy their Altars, and their Shrines deface?\nWho do's the Gods, and Goddesses dethrone,\nDenying all th' Immortal Powers, but one.\nI grant I still pursu'd the Christian Sect,\nAnd from just Heav'n I my Reward expect,\nFor sure th' Impartial Gods will ne'er condemn\nA Zeal that springs from Reverence to them.\n\nHe said. The King reply'd, Remorseless Wretch,\nCanst thou in Death such Consolation fetch,\nFrom thy black Guilt, which should thy Conscience Scare,\nAnd fill thy Breast with Terror and Despair?\nTho' thou with Guilt and Prejudice are blind\nThou in thy Torments wilt thy Error find.\nThis Hand shall send thee to the sad Reward\nBy Righteous Heav'n for Men of Blood prepar'd.\nThen thro' the Frank, extended on the Dust,\nHis Spear, the King with Indignation thrust.\nThro' his Left Pap it did its passage make,\nTransfixt his Breast and stuck within his Back.\nHe fetcht thick dying throbs, and double Sighs,\nWhile endless Night seal'd up his swimming Eyes.\n\nSoon as the Pagans saw their Champion dead,\nFrom Arthur's Arms the trembling Squadrons fled.\nThe Conquering King did eagerly pursue,\nAnd in the Chace prodigious Numbers slew.\nSo when tempestuous Boreas stretches forth\nHis furious Wings, and leaves the frozen North;\nTh' insulted Clouds dispers'd, and routed fly,\nO'er all the liquid Desarts of the Sky.\nThe swift Pursuer hangs upon the Rear,\nAnd drives the black Battalions thro' the Air.\n\nWhile beauteous Celon with a loosen'd Rein,\nFlew from the Conquering King across the Plain;\nHis Courser slipt, and fell by luckless Chance,\nTo take his Life the Monarch did advance.\nWhen old Velino who together fled,\nThe Danger saw, he turn'd his Courser's Head;\nBeneath the Victor's Feet himself he threw,\nAnd for his Son Young Celon thus did sue.\nO spare the Youth, and let, Victorious Prince,\nCompassion joyn'd with Power, the World convince,\nThat by Heroic Enterprises you,\nLaurels, but not with Cruelty, pursue.\nThe Gallic Forces to your Valour yield,\nAnd with inglorious Rout o'erspread the Field.\nIf you in Pity give, as I entreat,\nThe Youth his Life, your Vict'ry's still compleat.\nHe's not a Frank sprung from Germanic Race,\nBut from the Gauls who first possest this place.\nHis Mother was to Christian Faith inclin'd,\nAnd he was ever to the Christians Kind.\nThree of his Brothers on the Field lie slain,\nThis Son of Nine do's now alone remain;\nMy only Comfort, and my only Hope,\nOf my declining Age the single Prop.\nPity my hoary Head, his blooming years,\nThe Son's true Virtue, and the Father's Tears.\nPity, if you a Father are, express\nTo a sad Father in such vast distress:\nAt least the tender Passion you may know,\nThinking on that your Father show'd to you.\nAvert, great Prince, from Celon's Breast your Dart,\nStrike rather than the Son's, the Father's Heart.\n\nVelino ceas'd. And from his Eyes apace\nThe gushing Tears flow'd down his mournful Face.\nThe Pious King toucht with the moving Prayer,\nForbore the stroke, and did young Celon spare.\nOld Man, he cry'd, your Tears your Son reprieve,\nThus twice a Father to him Life you give.\n\nOrban a noble Velocassian Youth,\nWho once profess'd the Heav'nly Christian Truth,\nBut that his Wealth and Life might be secur'd,\nRenounc'd Religion, and his God abjur'd.\nNow felt King Arthur's Spear within his Reins,\nAnd finding Death creep Cold along his Veins:\nMad with Despair aloud th' Apostate cry'd,\nCurst be the hour when I my God deny'd.\nThe Ease, and Life, and Wealth I valu'd most,\nAre by the ways I strove to save them lost.\nNow must I Torments, Agonys, Despair,\nAnd everlasting Throws of Conscience bear.\nMore had he said, but interposing Death\nTo form his Words deny'd Supplys of Breath.\n\nThe King continu'd his pursuit, and made\nA dreadful Slaughter till the Evening Shade,\nTo stop the Victor's Course, did interpose\nBetween the Britons and their flying Foes.\nArthur return'd in Triumph to his Tent,\nWhere he to Heav'n, in solemn manner sent\nReligious Praises, and his God ador'd,\nWho once more, had with Conquest crown'd his Sword.Embed"
