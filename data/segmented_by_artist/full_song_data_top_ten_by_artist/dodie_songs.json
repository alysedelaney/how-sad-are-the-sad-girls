            "plain": "\u201cAir So Sweet\u201d originally came out as a demo on dodie\u2019s second YouTube channel, doddlevloggle, on October 16, 2018. The demo was originally about 52 seconds long, whereas iTunes lists the official release as 1:05 minutes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l2b_EtYRNgI\n\nIn the video shared to doddlevloggle, dodie associates this song with how happy she had been feeling in a particular moment. After she had finished a recording session with Jacob Collier, for what we can assume now was them recording their cover of \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d by The Beatles, dodie had felt just really happy. She associates \u201cAir So Sweet\u201d most to her running down her street barefoot (\u201cI was wearing shoes, but I liked the idea of not wearing shoes cuz that\u2019s what it felt like; I felt so grounded for once.\u201d) to her friend and fellow musician, Orla Gartland\u2019s house. From what she shared, this was just focused on the moment of running to Orla\u2019s house feeling excited that they were now neighbors and excited to tell Orla about how great and happy she had been feeling.\n\nThis bio was written before the official version of \u201cAir So Sweet\u201d was released"

                  "plain": "\u201cAir So Sweet\u201d originally came out as a demo on dodie\u2019s second YouTube channel, doddlevloggle, on October 16, 2018. The demo was originally about 52 seconds long, whereas iTunes lists the official release as 1:05 minutes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l2b_EtYRNgI\n\nIn the video shared to doddlevloggle, dodie associates this song with how happy she had been feeling in a particular moment. After she had finished a recording session with Jacob Collier, for what we can assume now was them recording their cover of \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d by The Beatles, dodie had felt just really happy. She associates \u201cAir So Sweet\u201d most to her running down her street barefoot (\u201cI was wearing shoes, but I liked the idea of not wearing shoes cuz that\u2019s what it felt like; I felt so grounded for once.\u201d) to her friend and fellow musician, Orla Gartland\u2019s house. From what she shared, this was just focused on the moment of running to Orla\u2019s house feeling excited that they were now neighbors and excited to tell Orla about how great and happy she had been feeling.\n\nThis bio was written before the official version of \u201cAir So Sweet\u201d was released"

The single marked the pair\u2019s first collaboration together, as well as Laufey\u2019s second official collaboration with another artist, (succeeding \u201cLet You Break My Heart Again\u201d featuring Philharmonia Orchestra).\n\nLyrically, the love song conveys the romance amidst the chilly, winter weather. Dodie also regarded the track as a Christmas song, likely due to its wintery, holiday-esque nature. Following its release, the track is now accompanied by an official lyric video on Laufey\u2019s YouTube channel."

                  "plain": "\u201cLove To Keep Me Warm\u201d is a single released on December 3rd, 2021, by Laufey featuring Dodie. The single marked the pair\u2019s first collaboration together, as well as Laufey\u2019s second official collaboration with another artist, (succeeding \u201cLet You Break My Heart Again\u201d featuring Philharmonia Orchestra).\n\nLyrically, the love song conveys the romance amidst the chilly, winter weather. Dodie also regarded the track as a Christmas song, likely due to its wintery, holiday-esque nature. Following its release, the track is now accompanied by an official lyric video on Laufey\u2019s YouTube channel."

That\u2019s what this song is about.\n\nUnlike many of Dodie\u2019s previous studio-produced songs, \u201cMonster\u201d is produced with far less acoustic instrumentation."

Two years have passed\nGod, twenty-seven, still cryin' in cars\nStop planning our lives on things that haven't been said\nWe're not dead\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWaitin' for the\nCount down, happy birthday\nDry heave, I am not okay\nBrain rot in a pretty dress\nI'm a hot mess\nWake up, do the same thing\nBreak up, then we're dancing\nWhy am I so alright to do it again and again?\n[Chorus]\nI can't fight it, you try drivin'\nExit to the end in sight, dear\nMake it ugly, put on a show\nHack it that I hate you so that I can let go\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne more reunion (One more)\nAnd goodbye again (Goodbye again)\nOh God, I'd be lying if I didn't want ten\nStop drafting replies to things that haven't been said\nH\u0435's not dead\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStill waitin' for the\nCount down, happy new y\u0435ar\nDon't know, I am still unclear\nWhere'd I go? Take a fuckin' guess\nI'm a hot mess\nWake up, do the same thing\nBreak up, then we're dancin'\nWhy am I so alright to do it again and again?\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't fight it, you try drivin'\nExit to the end in sight, dear\nMake it ugly, put on a show\nHack it that I hate you so that I can let go\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nLet me let go\nLet me let go\nLet me let go\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't fight it, you try drivin'\nExit to the end in sight, dear\nMake it ugly, put on a show\nHack it that I hate you so that I can let go\n\n[Outro]\nLet me let go (Let me let go)\nLet me let go (Ahh)\n(Let me let go)1Embed"
