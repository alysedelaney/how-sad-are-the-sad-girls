Aside from the East Coast/West Coast polarity, the shorter, sweeter, subtlety of \u201cNew York\u201d is completely juxtaposed by the wilder, longer, explosivity of \u201cLos Ageless.\u201d\n\nThe song features contributions from her uncle and aunt, Tuck and Patti Andress \u2013 also known as the long-running jazz duo Tuck & Patti."

Aside from the East Coast/West Coast polarity, the shorter, sweeter, subtlety of \u201cNew York\u201d is completely juxtaposed by the wilder, longer, explosivity of \u201cLos Ageless.\u201d\n\nThe song features contributions from her uncle and aunt, Tuck and Patti Andress \u2013 also known as the long-running jazz duo Tuck & Patti."

Annie Clark touched on this in her recent series of comedic faux-interview clips.\n\nAdditionally, there could be a much more literal take on this line. It  could be commentary on how people with breasts are often stuck, uncomfortably, behind a guitar \u2013 like girls in cages. Clark, however, has designed a guitar that is more fitting and comfortable for people with breasts, and thus this line may allude to this.\n\nCage dancing has its origins in the \u201860s at the Whisky-a-Go-Go, which was then one of the hottest clubs on the Sunset Strip."

            "plain": "\u201cNew York\u201d is the first single from St. Vincent\u2019s  MASSEDUCTION.  Clark debuted the song a year prior to the record\u2019s release at a benefit concert. Originally, the song lacked a chorus and was a stripped down piano ballad.\n\nSpeaking with The Line of Best Fit, Clark said:\n\nWriting that song, I loved it. I thought it was really direct and emotional. People might have thought I was going to zig, so I zagged.\n\n\u201cNew York\u201d could be seen as the antithetical sister to the album\u2019s second single, \u201cLos Ageless\u201d. Aside from the East Coast/West Coast polarity, the wilder, longer, explosivity of \u201cLos Ageless\u201d is sharply contrasted by the shorter, sweeter, subtlety of \u201cNew York\u201d. Additionally, \u201cNew York\u201d is notably more intimate, with Clark stripping away a lot of the instrumentals that she\u2019s known for, just as New York City is a compact and somewhat intimate city."

                  "plain": "\u201cNew York\u201d is the first single from St. Vincent\u2019s  MASSEDUCTION.  Clark debuted the song a year prior to the record\u2019s release at a benefit concert. Originally, the song lacked a chorus and was a stripped down piano ballad.\n\nSpeaking with The Line of Best Fit, Clark said:\n\nWriting that song, I loved it. I thought it was really direct and emotional. People might have thought I was going to zig, so I zagged.\n\n\u201cNew York\u201d could be seen as the antithetical sister to the album\u2019s second single, \u201cLos Ageless\u201d. Aside from the East Coast/West Coast polarity, the wilder, longer, explosivity of \u201cLos Ageless\u201d is sharply contrasted by the shorter, sweeter, subtlety of \u201cNew York\u201d. Additionally, \u201cNew York\u201d is notably more intimate, with Clark stripping away a lot of the instrumentals that she\u2019s known for, just as New York City is a compact and somewhat intimate city."

The vocals are engineered to sound fuzzy and distant, representing the haze between 2-D and his loved ones."

Strange Mercy seems like it might be influenced by Talking Heads' Fear of Music.\n\n\n\nIn St. Vincent\u2019s situation, no one takes time to appreciate her music because it\u2019s not the typical pop style, but no one hates on it either.

On that idea, the song can be seen as about peer pressure and social norms. People tend to be pretty \u201ccasually cruel\u201d when one doesn\u2019t fit society\u2019s idea of normal.\n\nSt. Vincent could be reflecting upon her frustration with the beginning of her career, when she was laboring to create art but not appreciated for it. There was the societal pressure of making music fit for popular demand, not the honest music St. Vincent wanted to make."

In some ways, doing the work that I do is about reinventing a value system. More or less, there\u2019s a ubiquitous value system in America, these markers that signify your rite of passage into adulthood or into validity: getting married and having kids and having mortgages. But I always felt a little bit like an alien cocking my head to the side at various cultural milestones, going, \u2018I would never aspire to that.\u2019 I\u2019ve chosen a line of work and a community that doesn\u2019t abide by the same value system. My markers are more about the things that I make and do, and I am happiest when I\u2019m forging ahead and watching the Rubik\u2019s cube slowly come together\u2014or being midway through the process and going, \u2018This isn\u2019t a Rubik\u2019s cube at all.\u2019 That\u2019s not any sort of indictment on other people\u2019s mile markers, they\u2019re just not mine; those markers aren\u2019t a threat to me, and my choices shouldn\u2019t be a threat to them. I just had to eschew one paradigm to be free enough to construct another."

              "Nihilism is the philosophical belief that life has no meaning. People who hold this position (called nihilists), are often stereotyped as being gloomy and overtly pessimistic, due to their bleak view on the world.\n\nBut many nihilists actually find their belief to be quite liberating, because if life is meaningless and nothing matters, you\u2019re basically free to do whatever you want till the day you die.\n\nThis seems to be maintained in these lines, as the nihilist, who is expected to be depressed, is smiling, whereas the person who chooses to find hope and meaning in life, the \u201cglass half full\u201d, is angry.\n\n\u201cGlass half full\u201d comes from the popular expression, \u201cglass half empty, or half full\u201d, which is used to gauge if a person views things pessimistically, or optimistically. If they view the glass as half empty, they tend to lose hope quickly even though they may have a fighting chance. But those who view the glass as half full are brimming with hope, choosing to see all the possibilities even in uncertain situations.\n\nFrom all of this, it could be assumed that St. Vincent herself is a nihilist, as it would tie in very well with the theme of this song. Because they believe nothing matters (especially social norms), nihilists choose a life of freedom and self acceptance rather than doing what society expects of them\u2014refusing to turn off what turns them on."

          [
            [
              "Teenagers in highly Christian communities are often stereotyped as finding workarounds for the prohibition of sexual intercourse before marriage. These can include anal sex or the blowjob described in these lines. The action of the virgins holding out their tongues alludes to the \u201cmoney shot\u201d of hardcore porn \u2013\u00a0the footage of ejaculation that lends a claim of realism to pornography.\n\nThe lyrical money shot itself, however, is an unsexy comedown to the fantasy of the \u201cteenage, Christian virgin.\u201d The basement rug indicates a secretive setting for the act, which is tinged with paranoia.\n\nThe first two lines also allude to the Catholic tradition of receiving Communion, in which churchgoers hold out their tongues to receive the wafer synonymous with the body of Christ.\n\n\u201cParanoid secretions / fallin' on basement rugs\u201d could definitely be a reference to Onan in Genesis 38:9-10. This passage is often cited to deem masturbation or non-procreative sex as sinful in Christianity:\n\nBut Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother\u2019s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. What he did was wicked in the Lord\u2019s sight; so the Lord put him to death also.\"\n\nThe actual issue, though, involved neither masturbation nor non-procreative sex. Onan was taking part in a levirate marriage to produce a male heir for his childless older dead brother that would be considered the brother\u2019s child and an extension of the life of his brother. By spilling his seed, Onan was in essence practicing fratricide by ensuring the end of his brother\u2019s line and increasing his own inheritance."

This, for Nabokov, became a larger metaphor for American crassness and commercial vulgarity more generally.  Here is the passage where Humbert reveals the full extent of his utter depravity:\n\nWe had been everywhere. We had really seen nothing. And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy, enormous country, that, by then, in retrospect, was no more than a collection of dog-eared maps, ruined tour books, old tires and her sobs in the night\u2014every night, every night\u2014the moment I feigned sleep."

It must have been something large that swept through an entire house. The second detail is that St. Vincent is probably younger than adolescent, referring to her father as her \u201cdaddy\u201d. She is still reliant on him for shelter.\n\nThis muddy damage to the drapes now makes the house look like that of a broken, messy family. Maybe the thing that hurt \u201choney\u201d is the same thing that caused the degradation of little Annie\u2019s family."

Their destructive self is visible on their clothing, that\u2019s noticeably soaked with something. Probably the liquid remnant of the harming thing, like their own blood.\n\nDirtied clothes from self-destruction is mentioned in another one of Annie\u2019s songs, Weekend in the Dust, from her collaboration with David Byrne,\n\nDare to keep our shirts on rolling in the muck\n\nBoth lines reminisce a stain left on one\u2019s self after being in a destructive state of filth."

Take the title track of Strange Mercy or Now Now where she mixes the caring and the ruthless.\n\n\n\nHere she tenderly asks where the hurt is before giving way to a soothing threat. This hints at a deep crack in the speaker\u2019s relationship."
