The song was released simulatenously with the album announcement as the first of eleven tracks on the album.\n\n\u201canything\u201d does not sound far off from the rest of Big Thief\u2019s work\u2014it carries the same enchanting vocals and tender lyrics\u2014but is especially similar to Lenker\u2019s previous solo works, which are more folk-infused and sparse in instrumentation."

The song was released simulatenously with the album announcement as the first of eleven tracks on the album.\n\n\u201canything\u201d does not sound far off from the rest of Big Thief\u2019s work\u2014it carries the same enchanting vocals and tender lyrics\u2014but is especially similar to Lenker\u2019s previous solo works, which are more folk-infused and sparse in instrumentation."

            "plain": "For GQ, Lenker said:\nIngydar was the name of my great-aunt Becky\u2019s horse, who passed away when I was a kid. But the song itself, I have to say, it isn\u2019t really about that horse. That was just a fragment from the pool of ideas, or colors that I wove into the song, but yeah. \u201cEverything eats and is eaten / Time is fed.\u201d Have you ever used a vacuum cleaner, and there\u2019s a button that sucks the cord back in?\n\nI imagine life being like the cord, and just being sucked back into the mouth of time, or that time is built up of experience in life. I suppose this is a pretty common thing to think about and philosophize about, but just looking at it as nonlinear, and as like a big orb or sphere, or maybe shapeless, but not with a before and an after and like a linear trajectory, but actually cyclical. Everything is constantly being born and decaying simultaneously. We\u2019re both growing and becoming, and also unbecoming and decaying simultaneously. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this inherent duality within everything. I was going through a transition in a relationship at the time that was so painful and still is, but that feeling of our relationship just being eaten, or the idea of like, whatever state we\u2019re in now, me and this person that were in this relationship, it\u2019s our relationship, and all the journey and processing we had to go through was the sacrifice for our new state of being. And it was eaten by time.\n\nhttps://www.gq.com/story/adrianne-lenker-songs-instrumentals-interview"

                  "plain": "For GQ, Lenker said:\nIngydar was the name of my great-aunt Becky\u2019s horse, who passed away when I was a kid. But the song itself, I have to say, it isn\u2019t really about that horse. That was just a fragment from the pool of ideas, or colors that I wove into the song, but yeah. \u201cEverything eats and is eaten / Time is fed.\u201d Have you ever used a vacuum cleaner, and there\u2019s a button that sucks the cord back in?\n\nI imagine life being like the cord, and just being sucked back into the mouth of time, or that time is built up of experience in life. I suppose this is a pretty common thing to think about and philosophize about, but just looking at it as nonlinear, and as like a big orb or sphere, or maybe shapeless, but not with a before and an after and like a linear trajectory, but actually cyclical. Everything is constantly being born and decaying simultaneously. We\u2019re both growing and becoming, and also unbecoming and decaying simultaneously. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this inherent duality within everything. I was going through a transition in a relationship at the time that was so painful and still is, but that feeling of our relationship just being eaten, or the idea of like, whatever state we\u2019re in now, me and this person that were in this relationship, it\u2019s our relationship, and all the journey and processing we had to go through was the sacrifice for our new state of being. And it was eaten by time.\n\nhttps://www.gq.com/story/adrianne-lenker-songs-instrumentals-interview"
