Were you involved?\u201d He said no.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before you stated you\u2019d be willing to take us out and show us where the vehicle\u2019s parked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No problem.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you still willing to do that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes sir.\n\nAutomated voice\nThis is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility. This call will be recorded and monitored. If you wish to...\n\n(brief interlude with music)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okay. My name is Miss Stella Armstrong. Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you were a juror on the Adnan Syed case, right?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes I was.\n\nSarah Koenig\nFrom This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it\u2019s Serial. One story told week by week. I\u2019m Sarah Koenig.\nI wanted to know, from Stella Armstrong, why she voted to convict Adnan Syed. She immediately talked about Jay, that she believed him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like I said, it\u2019s been a while but I remember the one young man who was supposedly his friend, who had enabled him to move the body. That struck me that \u201cwhy would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn\u2019t done it?\u201d You know what I mean? For what reason? What was he going to gain from that? He still had to go to jail.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. Actually he didn't go to jail.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh he didn\u2019t? The friend didn\u2019t?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No. He walked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh! That\u2019s strange. That\u2019s strange.\nSarah Koenig\nI asked Stella the same thing I ask anyone who has come into contact with Jay. What is Jay\u2019s deal? And by that I don\u2019t mean his plea deal, that he plead guilty to accessory after the fact in a first-degree murder, testified against Adnan, and got no prison time as a result. I\u2019ll talk more about that in another episode. What I mean is, \u201cwhat did you make of Jay?\u201d Which, of course, is code for \u201cwhat am I supposed to make of Jay?\u201d How did he come across, sitting up there on the witness stand?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was his demeanor on the stand? What kind of kid did he seem like?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He seemed like he was streetwise, can I-- I hope that\u2019s the best way to put it. He seemed like he got around in the neighborhoods, or he was able to take care of himself. He reminded me of-- he would be that friend if you got in trouble you would call. You know what I mean? Say if I was back in high school and somebody was bothering me, he reminded me of somebody I would call to help me. Like if somebody was fighting me, or--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it was believable to you that he would be that guy for Adnan, like he would be the guy Adnan would turn to.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, yeah. That was my impression. Because we all have somebody in our life like that, you know. You may know a cousin or a relative who if something goes wrong, you think you can call to help you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When you just said that, I just did a very quick scan of all of my contacts in my family and I feel like I can\u2019t think of one. They\u2019re all so useless! (laughs)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We won't say \u201cthey\u2019re all so useless.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nThe Jay that Stella saw at trial, he was wearing a tie, sometimes a jacket. He\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s tall and thin. You can see in the trial video how he has to bend over a little each time he speaks into the microphone in front of him. Since Jay\u2019s credibility was the State\u2019s case, Adnan\u2019s attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, tried to rip it to shreds. That essentially was her defense. She uses the words \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201clie\u201d as often as possible in her cross-examination. There were many exchanges like this one. Gutierrez asks him, \u201cand now your second interview on tape, that you were not telling the truth, were you not?\u201d Jay says:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not telling them everything, no.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What you were telling them were lies. Were they not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the answer to my question is \u201cyes, I was not telling the truth,\u201d is it not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prosecutor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objection.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sustained.\n\nSarah Koenig\nGutierrez asks Jay about Best Buy. About how Jenn Pusateri told him there were security cameras in the parking lot and at the entrance. If Jay didn't kill Hae, why would Jay care whether there were cameras there, she asks. She puts it to Jay almost casually.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You have us believe--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prosecutor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objection.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--that you had nothing to do with the death of Hae Lee, right?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sustained.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One more question. Did you kill Hae Min Lee?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You weren\u2019t present when she was killed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defense attorney tried to make him-- well basically she was trying to show that Jay killed her, and was blaming it on Adnan. That\u2019s what I remember. Nothing led us to believe that he had a motive to kill Miss Lee. That really stayed with me because she was so adamant that he was a liar.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right, so you just didn\u2019t buy that he was lying about it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella Armstrong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t buy that it was a lie. I bought the fact that he was telling the truth about what happened at that moment.\nSarah Koenig\nJay took the stand on five different days during the second trial. This must have been a harrowing, nerve racking stretch in his life, but large swathes of the trial itself are really boring. Not just the procedural stuff, that\u2019s always boring, but the cross-examination was boring. Even of the star witness. One defense attorney I talked to said that boringness can be a strategy. She said lawyers know that people can only pay close attention for so long. Forty-five minutes, an hour, before they start to flag. So it\u2019s not theatrics that gets people to crack, it\u2019s tedium; which would explain so much of what Gutierrez was doing if in fact that was what she was doing. She spends a lot of time on streets for instance, the trajectories of different roads, whether they travel northeast, or northwest, whether their names change as they cross from the city into the county, on buildings, how they\u2019re situated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that Best Buy is a boxy structure with the Best Buy logo at an angle, is it not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it\u2019s plainly visible from Security Boulevard, is it not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right at the (cough covers speech) it changes its name, there\u2019s a light there that if you were not on Security Boulevard, but on that street and you went straight you would go into the parking lot of Security Mall, correct?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay doesn\u2019t crack though. He is alert, he is polite, he is he stays with her. He stays with her when she\u2019s calm and soothing and boring, and he stays with her when she gets a little more shouty. He sticks to the \u201cyes ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am\u201d answers which, if I had to guess, is probably seventy-five percent of what Jay says in cross. There is a part where Gutierrez tries to suggest that Jay was cheating on his girlfriend Stephanie with Jenn Pusateri.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you were stepping out on Stephanie, that would have had impacted on your relationship, would it have not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With whom?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With anyone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Stephanie?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you were stepping out on Stephanie, you understand what that term means don\u2019t you?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okay, if you had another girlfriend, anyone, any name, any where, that would have impacted with Stephanie would it have not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t hear the last part.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you were stepping out with any girl of any name, from any location, that would have impacted your relationship with your girlfriend Stephanie would it have not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Gutierrez\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you were always aware of that, weren\u2019t you?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes ma\u2019am.\n\nSarah Koenig\nEven when he gets irritated, Jay is civil. \u201cExcuse me, your honor,\u201d he says when Gutierrez gets loud, \u201ccould you ask her to stop yelling in my ear please?\u201d Gutierrez died a few years after this trial, so I can\u2019t ask her, but I have to think nothing she\u2019s doing here is accidental. She was a successful, sought after defense attorney. She was aggressive. And obviously the courtroom is no place for pulling punches, but you gotta wonder whether moments like this hurt Adnan\u2019s case rather than helped it, because, Jay seems like the underdog. It\u2019s Baltimore. Half the jury is black, seven out of twelve actually. Jay probably comes off as a nice young man and this white lady is yelling at him. Sometimes unwittingly or not, Jay\u2019s testimony is almost poetic. He says he told Jenn Pusateri to be honest with the detectives because \u201cthe lies that we were telling to try to protect each other were clouding the truth.\u201d When he\u2019s asked why he didn\u2019t warn Hae that Adnan wanted to kill her, he says it was because he didn\u2019t think Adnan was serious. \u201cI took it as a grain of sand instead of concrete.\u201d And when he\u2019s asked why the image of Hae in the trunk of a car stuck with him, he says \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone dead before, and the first thing I thought was how fragile Stephanie was.\u201d\n\nPeople lie in court under oath all the time. Witnesses lie. Lawyers lie. Police lie. This should come as a shocker to no one. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what happened here, I\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m not assuming that everyone who participated in Adnan\u2019s trial told the truth. But clearly the jury found Jay believable, or believable enough. After a six week trial, they convicted Adnan in just two hours. We talked to six jurors and none of them had any lingering doubts about the case. None of them wondered if the investigation was shoddy. None of them were much bothered by how Jay\u2019s statements to police had shifted over time. So am I wrong to be hung up on that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should be concerned about the inconsistencies?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m concerned about them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You are?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, the detectives involved in this case didn\u2019t want to talk to me for this story, so I turned to this guy.\nYou are Jim Trainum. James? Do you like James or Jim?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim is fine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum, and we\u2019ve-- we hired you, because unlike me, you\u2019re a real detective. (laughs) I\u2019m just playing one on the radio.\nJim Trainum used to be a homicide detective in Washington D.C. A jurisdiction not too different from Baltimore. He\u2019s now become something of an expert on false confessions, and an advocate for better interrogation techniques. He goes around the country doing presentations about it. We gave Trainum everything we had on this case. Files, tapes, transcripts. Again, I want to be clear, we paid him for his time. It\u2019s a huge amount of material to go through. I wanted Trainum to weigh in on two things. First, just overall, how would he rate the investigation into Hae Min Lee\u2019s murder? Did the detectives do a good job, or did they screw it up? And second, how should I be thinking about Jay as a witness? What were the detectives seeing that maybe I wasn\u2019t? Trainum said yes, he thought the inconsistencies were a problem too. But he also said \u201cdon\u2019t forget the flipside.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I\u2019m also looking at some of the consistencies too. He took them to where the car was. That\u2019s a huge thing right there.\n\nSarah Koenig\nJay had a big piece of reliable information that the cops themselves did not know. Where Hae\u2019s car was. Plus, Trainum said, Jay\u2019s story completes a circle for the cops. They were suspicious of Adnan from the beginning, then from Adnan\u2019s cell records, they get to Jenn, who leads them to Jay, who tells them it\u2019s Adnan. So their suspicions have now been borne out, thanks to Jay, through Adnan\u2019s own phone. A satisfying investigative circle. A murder case, on a silver platter, says Trainum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He puts it on who they consider to be the logical suspect. I mean yeah, it\u2019s pretty much a dream case.\n\nSarah Koenig\nPart of what Trainum does is review investigations, and he says this one is better than most of what he sees. The detectives in this case were cautious and methodical. They weren\u2019t rushing to grab suspects or to dismiss them either. The evidence collection was well documented. I didn\u2019t expect to hear that even though its basically a one witness case, the cell records mostly don\u2019t match Jay\u2019s statements, there\u2019s no physical evidence linking Adnan to the murder. Despite all that, to an experienced detective like Trainum, this looks like a pretty sound investigation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would said that this is better than average.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But what I\u2019m saying is this: the mechanics, the documentation, the steps that they took, and all of that, they look good. Okay? I would have probably followed this same route. However, what we\u2019re unsure of is what happened to change Jay\u2019s story from A to B, and we do not know what happened in the interrogating-- those three hours and that will always result in a question as to what the final outcome should have been.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about. In both of Jay\u2019s taped statements, there\u2019s a before. A period of time before the tape recorder is turned on. When the cops first bring Jay in on February 28th, they talked to him for about an hour before the tape went on. Then, on March 15th, the second interview. Jay signs his initials to an official explanation of rights form at 3:15 p.m. Then the tape starts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today\u2019s date is the 15th of March. It\u2019s approximately twenty minutes after six at night.\n\nSarah Koenig\n6:20 p.m. So from 3:15 to 6:20, three hours have gone by since Jay signed that form. This is what\u2019s called the pre-interview, and Trainum says, that\u2019s where the mischief can happen. The contamination. Not necessarily intentionally, but it happens. The pre-interview was when the cops and the witness kind of iron out the statement so it can be taped as a coherent thing. That was standard procedure back then. Now, like a lot of jurisdictions, Baltimore homicide detectives videotape the entire interview from the moment the person steps in the interview room. On March 15th, we know the cops had shown Jay at least some photographs from the investigation, they refer to that on the tape. And Jay says at trial that he was confronted with the cell records during that interview as well, so you have to wonder, said Trainum, whether he was massaging his story to fit what the cops wanted to hear. The inconsistencies in Jay\u2019s statements that the cops are catching him in, Trainum says, cops are used to that. Every confession has inconsistencies.\n\nYou just need to understand why they\u2019re happening. Is he minimising his role? Is he protecting someone? In Jay\u2019s case, yes and yes. But how do you make sense of the inconsistencies that don\u2019t seem to have a purpose, like the one about going to the cliffs at Patapsco State Park that afternoon, how it drops out of the narrative at trial.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--and from where I sit, I\u2019m like, yeah, it doesn\u2019t work because it doesn\u2019t fit your timeline. He can\u2019t get back to track in time. If you went out and smoked a joint.You know what I mean, anyway, I\u2019m getting too deep in--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No, no, you\u2019re not at all because I think that one of the biggest problems that we have with the way that we interview and interrogate here. The fact that we have a excellent witness-- we\u2019ve got somebody who is giving us the whole case right here, he\u2019s broke it wide open for us, we don\u2019t want to ruin him, you know? So how much do you want to push, how much do you want to create \u201cbad evidence?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, there\u2019s no such thing--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s an actual term, called \u201cbad evidence.\u201d Right. You don\u2019t want to do something if it is going to go against your theory of the case.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, see-- I don\u2019t get that. I mean that\u2019s like what my father always used to always say, \u201call facts are friendly.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t that be more true for a cop than for anyone else? You can\u2019t pick and choose.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than trying to get to the truth, what you\u2019re trying to do is build your case, and make it the strongest case possible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, how can it be a strong case and how can he be a great witness if there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s not true, or unexplained.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--and the comeback is is that there is always going to be things that are unexplainable. Like I said, also remember, verification bias is kicking in here, as well. \u201cI want to believe you, because you\u2019re my witness and I think this is what happened\u201d and all that. \u201cSo, the fact that you\u2019re giving me something that\u2019s inconsistent, that doesn\u2019t fit my theory of the case.\u201d What does verification bias cause you to do? Ignore it and push it to the side. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing here, with these inconsistencies, they\u2019re kind of pushing them aside.\nSarah Koenig\nTrainum said it was curious to him, that the cops never searched Jay\u2019s house for instance, that they never subjected him to a polygraph. Again he said, maybe that\u2019s because he was on their team now, helping, so you didn\u2019t want to push too hard. He said the cops \u201cprobably settled for what was good enough to be the truth.\u201d He said he did have doubts about Adnan\u2019s claim of innocence but that he definitely thought there was something \u201coff\u201d about this case. That we still don\u2019t know what happened in this murder. We still don\u2019t have the true story.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t believe Jay\u2019s version. I think that there is a lot more to it than that. I feel that he\u2019s definitely minimizing his involvement. To either protect himself, he\u2019s doing it for one of three reasons: to protect himself, to protect somebody else, or because Adnan did it and was right there with him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right, right.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, I cannot prove that he is giving it to me without contamination. The real problem is is that, how do you prove it one way or the other?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right.\n\nSarah Koenig\nTrainum says the answers we want probably live in those unrecorded pre-interview hours. A black hole of crucial information. Since this stuff wasn\u2019t all videotaped, there were holes that, as you\u2019re saying, we are never going to know the answer. But for things that I could know the answer to if you\u2019re me, what\u2019s the biggest thing I need to figure out then?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Trainum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get Jay to talk.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okay, okay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Julie Snyder\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We passed the city limit.\n\nSarah Koenig\nMy producer, Julie Snyder and I, went to see Jay. We did not warn Jay we were coming, which is not the gentlest reporter move, I know. But I thought we\u2019d have the best chance of success if we met him face to face, so we could make our case for why we wanted to talk to him and he could have a better sense of who we were and what we were about. But, because it\u2019s also sort of a dick move to show up at someone\u2019s door like that, Julie and I were nervous. I am so hyped up, listening back to the tape, I wanted to give myself a Xanax.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I feel super excited to talk to him, like so excited to talk to him, I can\u2019t tell you. Like, if this works, he knows, he knows everything we want to know, every questions we\u2019ve had for the past eight months. Seven months, he knows it. Whether or not he tells us is a different thing but he\u2019s a treasure chest of answers that we\u2019ve been looking for this whole time and he has it, he\u2019s it. But, whether or not he opens the door, or if he\u2019s even home, we don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s home!\nSarah Koenig\nWe arrived, Jay was not home, so we came back again many hours later, knocked. Jay answered the door, tall and skinny and exhausted looking. A beer in his hand. It was Friday, probably the end of a long workday for him. He nevertheless invited us in, asked us to sit down. We didn\u2019t record anything, we stayed about 20 minutes maybe. It was a tense meeting, and an emotional meeting, in fact. Afterwards, Julie and I felt like we\u2019d walked into a stranger\u2019s house, lobbed a grenade onto his living room carpet and then waved goodbye. We debriefed back in the car.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Julie Snyder\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here\u2019s the first thing he said, I mean he said that there are a lot of people who say they don\u2019t think Adnan did it. He very forcefully said, \u201cwell then who did?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right, he said, \u201cwho did? I was there, I saw it, I know what I know.\u201d He was very forceful, \u201cI can\u2019t even believe that he won\u2019t even man up and admit it.\u201d He just totally scoffed at the idea that, Adnan would be claiming his innocence. He was very calm, like how would you describe his demeanor?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Julie Snyder\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tired. Yeah, he seemed tired and wary. But actually very polite and actually sort of very sweet, and, tired and-- but he also said \u201cI\u2019m feeling so much animal rage right now even you bringing this up right now.\u201d Which, he does a good job of, keeping it in, because he didn\u2019t seem like he was about to-- I mean actually you could kind of see him about to hit something, but in a more frustrated, understandable way.\nSarah Koenig\nJay was, understandably, skeptical of us and of our motives. When we left, Jay said he\u2019d think about an interview and get back to us. He left a strong impression. On Julie maybe, even more than on me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Julie Snyder\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even just hearing him so forcefully deny, you know? And so forcefully say \u201cI know he did it.\u201d You know, you\u2019re face to face, he\u2019s right there, he\u2019s a person. He\u2019s saying it. He seems like he really means it. This is not pleasant for him to talk about. And so, it sounds believable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It does, I totally saw the appeal of him, as like a person and a friend and a witness.\nSarah Koenig\nJay and I corresponded sporadically by e-mail in the weeks following our meeting. He said he wasn\u2019t afraid of the truth. Finally, in so many words, Jay declined an interview.\n\nSo, what is the deal with Jay? I talked to dozens of people. Mostly his friends and classmates. Kids who knew him from Woodlawn High School, they have a range of opinions about whether he was a good guy or not a good guy. But they all agreed, that he defied categorization. He was different.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male Voice #1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was like the Rodman of our social world.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was the one black kid that had a lip ring and listened to Rage Against the Machine and you know--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Female Voice #1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would dye his hair different colors. Like, I think one time he had it red and another time he had it blonde. But the blonde lasted for a long time, I remember the blonde for sure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remember he had a BMX belt buckle. And he had a belt buckle, like who the hell had a belt buckle?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Female #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basically, Dennis Rodman is the best way I can describe it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You know, if he was at my house and my mom came home and he left, she\u2019d be like, \u201cwho\u2019s that and why is he here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was like, whoa, he\u2019s a weirdo. At the time, I didn\u2019t know too many black guys that were into all of those piercings and shit and the big gothic jeans like that. Again, Woodlawn was a fairly black neighborhood, black community, black-- predominantly black high school, and at seventeen, anything different from you is weird.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo Jay didn\u2019t look like the other kids at school and he also didn\u2019t act like the other kids at school. He loved animals, he once bought a giant rat eating frog, and he loved the outdoors. Fishing, hiking, swimming. He rode BMX bikes at an old skate park. He played lacrosse for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think Jay was actually pretty good at lacrosse. Tall wiry dude, he could run for days, there was no training needed for that kid, he could just run forever, which is a good thing as he wasn\u2019t the type to put in a ton of training in.\nSarah Koenig\nRight, because he wasn\u2019t a jock. He was more of a stoner people said. He didn\u2019t seem to care whether he fit in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male #7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he always seemed very honest with who he was. He was kind of this, beautifully unconventional guy.\nSarah Koenig\nJay didn\u2019t come from the same kind of household as a lot of the other kids he hung around with. He lived with his grandparents and his mom, but his friends say it seemed like he was more or less taking care of himself. He always had a job, his mother depended on him. Jay wasn\u2019t in the magnet program at Woodlawn, he was \u201cGen Pop\u201d, their term, not mine, like General Population at a prison. Anyway, he hung out with some of the magnet kids because his girlfriend Stephanie was in the program.\nPeople told me contradictory things about Jay. Three women who knew him from Woodlawn, including one teacher, told me unflattering things about him. Nothing terrible, just that he was mean, or intimidating. Some kids thought of him as \u201cshady\u201d, that you wouldn\u2019t want to push him. You got the sense that if you cross Jay, he\u2019d come after you.\n\nBut then, I also heard descriptions of Jay that included the word \u201cgoofy\u201d or \u201cstoner\u201d, or that the thuggish vibe was just a pose, something Jay put on to seem tough.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s, he\u2019s an alpha, he\u2019s definitely an alpha male.\nSarah Koenig\nThis is Chris who says he was one of Jay\u2019s best friends around this time. He said Jay might say, slug you as you\u2019re walking down the hallway at school, but he wasn\u2019t mad or anything, he\u2019s just messing around. Boys will be boys kind of stuff. Chris remembered this one story where it seemed to me all the different versions of Jay I\u2019d heard, the goofy and the scary, were contained in it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You know, we\u2019d have weird arguments sometimes I remember outside of one of my cousins houses he tried to stab me because I hadn\u2019t been stabbed before, so we got into a fight over-- actually I gave him a knife because I worked at a knife shop.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gave him a knife and then he tried to stab me with it, so we were literally like fighting outside of my cousin\u2019s house and he\u2019s like \u201cyo, I\u2019m not gonna stab you deep but you never been stabbed before, you need to know what it\u2019s like,\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cyo, I\u2019m not gonna let you stab me.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nI talked to three people who said they knew Jay well, or hung out with him around the time of the crime and I asked them if he ever told them about what happened. I went to Chris first because when Jay spoke to detectives that first night during his first taped interview, Jay mentioned Chris by name. The cops had asked Jay if he had told anyone else about Adnan committing this murder and Jay said he\u2019d told Chris. Chris told me police never questioned him, not that he could remember anyway and he thought he\u2019d remember something like that. There are no notes in their files about an interview with Chris. But Chris said it was true, Jay did tell him about what had happened, but his version, the building blocks are the same but the surrounding details are unfamiliar. Of course, giant caveat, it\u2019s fifteen years later that I\u2019m asking Chris to tell me, but for comparison purposes, here goes.\n\nChris says Jay told him he was at a pool hall out on Route 40 and Catonsville when he got a call from Adnan. The pool hall was either VIP or Bluejays, Chris says, they were across the street from each other at the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told you that Adnan came to get him when he was at a pool hall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was shooting pool, Adnan called him he was like \u201cyo, I gotta talk to you,\u201d and he was like \u201cyo I\u2019m busy.\u201d \u201cYo, where are you\u201d and he told him where he was. Adnan showed up and he\u2019s like \u201coh I gotta talk to you\u201d and he\u2019s like-- this was a little tug of war for a while and Adnan eventually convinced him to come outside with him and his car or, I don\u2019t know if he was driving his car or Hae Lee\u2019s.\n\nSarah Koenig\nIn this version the trunk pop happens at the pool hall. Chris said Jay told Adnan he wanted nothing to do with it but Adnan forced him, told him he was in it now, he was an accessory and he knew Jay couldn\u2019t go to the cops because of his own illegal activities so Jay was stuck. He helped bury the body. Chris figured Leakin Park was likely Jay\u2019s idea rather than Adnan\u2019s. Chris\u2019s information about the crime itself doesn\u2019t quite match the State\u2019s version. He said, Jay told him that Adnan confronted Hae about flirting with another guy, a car salesman and when she called Adnan crazy, he snapped and strangled her. And Chris said he heard this happened in the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library. Remember that\u2019s the one that\u2019s right on campus where Asia said she saw Adnan that day.\nChris says Jay told him that Adnan threatened to kill Stephanie if Jay didn\u2019t keep his mouth shut. This is not the first I\u2019d heard about something like this. Jay told the cops that he worried that Adnan would hurt Stephanie too and he also testified at trial that Adnan has made it clear that he could get to Stephanie any time he wanted since they were such good friends. Stephanie herself tells the cops, this is in their notes of their conversation with her, that Jay told her to stay away from Adnan. Chris says Jay told him Adnan showed up at Jay\u2019s house with Stephanie not long after the crime and made a gesture to indicate \u201cI\u2019ll hurt her if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Stephanie goes inside past Jay and he steps out onto the porch with Adnan and he says \u201cyou\u2019re not going to terrorize me,\u201d and Adnan says \u201cyou keep your mouth shut or something\u2019s going to happen.\u201d If he had any weakness, it was Stephanie. Jay would do, he would move heaven and earth if it came to protecting Stephanie.\nSarah Koenig\nI talked to Laura, a friend of Jay\u2019s and Stephanie\u2019s and Jen\u2019s and of Adnan\u2019s. Back then she was Laura Estrada Sandolo. She was close with Stephanie, they played sports together.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laura\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her parents didn\u2019t agree with their relationship because he was just-- they felt he wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything. He wasn\u2019t going to school. Stephanie, she\u2019s beautiful. She was a star athlete. She got a scholarship at college. She\u2019s perfect you know. She ran the fastest, she was always in shape no matter what. She could eat anything and she always saw the good in people no matter what, no matter if her parents were telling her he\u2019s not a good influence on you. But because she loved Jay so much, she was going to support him regardless. She was his good thing in life. He was like, \u201cout of all the craziness, Stephanie was his amazingness.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nStephanie didn\u2019t want to talk to me and no one I spoke to who knows her wasn\u2019t surprised by that. To a person they said she never talked to them about what happened either. They said it was like a wall came down and they couldn\u2019t penetrate it. Laura told me it kind of did in their friendship because Laura really needed to talk about it and Stephanie wouldn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t.\n\nLaura hung out with Jay all that summer before the trial and she says they just didn\u2019t discuss it. Hae\u2019s murder was this enormous, sad, frightening elephant nobody wanted to go near. Jay\u2019s friend Patrick told me he couldn\u2019t get Jay to talk about it either.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patrick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think I just kept saying, \u201cWhat happened? What in God\u2019s name happened? In all this, like--\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nThis Patrick by the way isn\u2019t the one I\u2019ve already mentioned in an earlier episode from the call log, different Patrick. This Patrick went to Woodlawn, he was a year ahead of Jay, so two years ahead of Adnan and Hae and Stephanie. Patrick lost touch with Jay when all this went down. He says he tried and tried to call but Jay never responded. Years later, maybe around 2005, Jay got back in touch one day and then they saw each other at a little party. Patrick asked him about it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patrick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d heard all of these like renditions and versions of stories from so many people, I figured, I have him in front of me now, I can get to the truth and he said \u201cyeah, I was afraid he was gonna hurt Stephanie.\u201d I said \u201clike Adnan? He was gonna-- did he threaten her?\u201d He just said he was afraid that he was going to hurt her so I think he took it as a threat but I remember when I pushed him for detail when I pushed him for more, it wasn\u2019t-- I didn\u2019t get it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wasn\u2019t going to go any further with it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patrick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He just wasn\u2019t, you know and there was a lot of it-- kind of the chummy punching me in the shoulder kinda like \u201cc\u2019mon man, let\u2019s just drink beer and hang out.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nPatrick says the Stephanie explanation sounded pretty thin to him, but he couldn\u2019t get anything else out of Jay and figured it wasn\u2019t his place to force it. I asked all Jay\u2019s friends I spoke to whether they thought Jay was telling the truth about what happened that night. I got some curious answers because his friends say Jay has a reputation for lying, but not for lying about something like that, something so big. Sort of the same way he had a reputation for being scary, but not scary-scary.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cathy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that popped into my head was \u201cJay lies. That\u2019s why he does that. Jay lies about everything.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Cathy. Again, that\u2019s not her real name or her real voice. She\u2019s the person who said Adnan was acting weird at her apartment that night of the murder when Jay brought him over.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cathy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When you were talking about it and saying, well you know, Jay has all these inconsistencies and stuff. The first thing that popped into my head was \u201cthat\u2019s because Jay lies. Jay doesn\u2019t tell the truth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But like about what? What kinds of stuff are you thinking of?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cathy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everything. I think he was kind of like, about everything, nothing. I can definitely remember sometimes when Jay was telling a story and he would clearly know it was bullshit. I remember one time looking at Jenn and Jenn would roll her eyes like \u201chere we go again. This is such bullshit.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nBoth Chris and Patrick told me that Jay would tell them stories, tall tales almost, that they figured had to be made up, but then sometimes these stories turned out to be true. Cathy said \u201csure, Jay might lie about what he had for breakfast or even whether he went to Patapsco State Park on the afternoon of January 13 1999,\u201d but she didn\u2019t think that Jay was lying about the crime itself because she\u2019s convinced Adnan is guilty based on Adnan\u2019s behavior that night and what he was saying when he got that phone call at her house.\n\nThen there\u2019s Jenn Pusateri. Of all the people Jay told about this crime, I wondered most about Jenn. If she ever thought Jay was lying about that night. I spoke to her briefly at her work, she works at a discount store. She wasn\u2019t rude, but she was totally uninterested in talking to me. She had nothing to hide, she said, she just did not want to talk about that time in her life, period. She did answer my one big question, though, and her answer was yes. She believed Jay then, and that hasn\u2019t changed in the intervening years. I said, yeah, but he did lie to you somewhat back then. Remember, he tells Jenn that night that he doesn\u2019t know where Adnan put Hae\u2019s body. That they don\u2019t know enough to go to the police. Jenn told me she could understand that kind of lie. That anyone in his position forced into something he wanted no part of, anyone might have told the same kind of lie. It didn\u2019t shake her trust in his overall story. Then she added, there was one thing she never believed. She said she never believed the murder happened at Best Buy, because she thought there would have been security footage, and that never came out. I told her it seems like maybe there really weren\u2019t security cameras at Best Buy back then, and she kind of shrugged and said: \u201cOh well, see, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people I talked to said when they heard Jay was wrapped up in a murder, it didn\u2019t surprise them. Adnan, they said no way, shocking. But Jay? Not so shocking. People also said they couldn\u2019t square Jay feeling threatened by Adnan. The dynamic of that just seemed wrong to them. But then there\u2019s Patrick, and Laura, and Cathy, people who\u2019d spent a lot of time with Jay, people who were shocked by Jay\u2019s involvement. They couldn\u2019t see why Adnan would even turn to Jay for something like that, it made no sense. They said that wasn\u2019t the laid-back Jay they knew, the same thing almost every single one of Adnan\u2019s friends says about him. So they end up in this inbetween place where they can\u2019t quite wrap their minds around the story of that night. Here\u2019s Patrick again. To him, Jay was this intelligent, inquisitive, sweet, goofy guy, beautifully unconventional.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patrick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think part of me hopes-- I know this is so terrible to say. I hope in some way his hand was forced, that he was, that he had no choice, or that things were outside of his control, and maybe he was looking out for the safety and wellbeing of others, and he wasn\u2019t such a willing participant as he was, and I, certainly hope that he wasn\u2019t.\nSarah Koenig\nThat grappling you can hear in his voice, that\u2019s so common among this group of friends. People like Laura, who can\u2019t imagine Adnan killing anyone, but also can\u2019t imagine Jay doing what he said he did, or why he would lie about something so huge. If you\u2019re Laura and there\u2019s no scenario here you can rationalize, you\u2019re left with fog. This piece of tape I\u2019m about to play you, it\u2019s my favourite piece of tape from all my reporting so far, because I relate to it so precisely. It could be me talking to Laura, instead of the other way around.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laura\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well then who the fuck did it, like, why would-- it doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would-- (stuttering) Hae was-- I can\u2019t-- I\u2019m probably just as confused as you are.\nSarah Koenig\nAt Jay\u2019s sentencing for his accessory after the fact conviction, he\u2019s wearing a white shirt, his long arms hanging at his side. He\u2019s towering over his lawyer who\u2019s petite. She tells the judge all the stuff a defense attorney tends to cover at a sentencing, Jay\u2019s tough upbringing, that he didn\u2019t have adults helping him set a moral compass, that he\u2019s hard working and loves animals and is good with kids, that he\u2019s headed to college and wants to better himself. She says he underwent \u201crigorous and demeaning cross examination on the part of Christina Gutierrez\u201d and she says he\u2019s remorseful. She says, just now he was weeping in the hallway about Hae Lee.\nProsecutor Kevin Urick tells the judge he\u2019s thoroughly pleased with Jay\u2019s participation in the case and impressed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kevin Urick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--as I said very satisfactory and I believe honestly testified and also I would say something you don\u2019t usually see I think he actually showed remorse during-- I saw real remorse on his part so I\u2019d be happy to make that recommendation on his--\nSarah Koenig\nThe judge is impressed too and Jay does seem genuinely torn up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything you wanna say before I impose sentence?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just that, whatever you do decide, I\u2019d like you to know that I have a real hard time even sitting here, because I feel like people look at me and they think I\u2019m a horrible person and that, I\u2019m really sorry for my part in what happened.\nSarah Koenig\nThe judge sentences Jay to two years probation, no jail time. His lawyer mouths the words \u2018thank you\u2019 to the judge. Jay leaves the courtroom with the only person who came with him that day, Stephanie.\n\nAdnan didn\u2019t testify at his trial, which isn\u2019t unusual. Jurors aren\u2019t supposed to take that into consideration. The judge tells them so. That they are not allowed to hold that against a defendant when they\u2019re deliberating.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Did it bother you guys as a jury that Adnan himself didn\u2019t testify, didn\u2019t take the stand?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lisa Flynn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, it did.\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Lisa Flynn, one of the jurors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lisa Flynn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was huge. We just-- yeah, that was huge. We all kinda like gasped like, we were all just blown away by that. You know, why not, if you\u2019re a defendant, why would you not get up there and defend yourself, and try to prove that the State is wrong, that you weren\u2019t there, that you\u2019re not guilty? We were trying to be so open minded, it was just like, get up there and say something, try to persuade, even though it\u2019s not your job to persuade us, but, I don\u2019t know.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo what was Adnan thinking while all this was going down? What do I know about Adnan that the jury didn\u2019t.\nNext time, on Serial.12Embed"
