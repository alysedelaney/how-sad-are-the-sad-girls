In 2023, Roan performed alongside local drag queens in Nashville the same day that the Tennesse General Assembly passed a bill prohibiting drag shows in non age-restricted venues. Of the show, she said:\n\nIt was a very emotional show, it was heartbreaking,\u201d she says passionately, tearing up. \u201cTo know that I was one of the last shows that would happen with all ages with drag performers [for now] is just\u2026 I am not scared, because the queer community is strong, we have each other\u2019s backs, and we will overcome hate.

            "plain": "\u201cMy Kink Is Karma\u201d is a song by the American singer-songwriter Chappell Roan. The song is about the concept of karma, which is the idea that our actions in this life will have consequences in the future. In the song, Roan explores the idea of how the universe will eventually bring justice to those who do wrong, and that the cycle of cause and effect will catch up with them.\n\nThe title \u201cMy Kink Is Karma\u201d is a play on words; the phrase \u201cmy kink is\u2026\u201d is often used in pop culture to describe an unusual or unconventional sexual preference. However, in this song, Roan is using the phrase to express her belief that the concept of karma is what drives her actions and decisions in life, particularly with regard to her ex-lover.\n\nOverall, the song is a thought-provoking exploration of the idea of karma and its place in our lives, with Roan\u2019s haunting vocals and poignant lyrics adding depth and emotion to the message."

                  "plain": "\u201cMy Kink Is Karma\u201d is a song by the American singer-songwriter Chappell Roan. The song is about the concept of karma, which is the idea that our actions in this life will have consequences in the future. In the song, Roan explores the idea of how the universe will eventually bring justice to those who do wrong, and that the cycle of cause and effect will catch up with them.\n\nThe title \u201cMy Kink Is Karma\u201d is a play on words; the phrase \u201cmy kink is\u2026\u201d is often used in pop culture to describe an unusual or unconventional sexual preference. However, in this song, Roan is using the phrase to express her belief that the concept of karma is what drives her actions and decisions in life, particularly with regard to her ex-lover.\n\nOverall, the song is a thought-provoking exploration of the idea of karma and its place in our lives, with Roan\u2019s haunting vocals and poignant lyrics adding depth and emotion to the message."

In this context, \u201ckink\u201d is being used figuratively to express a fascination or obsession with a particular topic or behavior.\n\nThe chorus of the song further emphasizes the concept of karma and its consequences. The singer implies that she is not concerned about the person\u2019s behavior because she believes that the universe will eventually bring justice and the person will reap what they sow.\n\nOverall, the lyrics suggest a sense of detachment and detachment towards the person\u2019s situation, while also exploring the themes of cause and effect and the concept of karma."
