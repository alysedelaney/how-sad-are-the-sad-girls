To him, it\u2019s one of real skill\n\n[Refrain]\nSo glad to meet you, Angeles\n\n[Verse 2]\nPicking up the ticket shows, there's money to be made\nGo on and lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade\nDid you add up all the cards left to play to zero?\n[Refrain]\nAnd sign up with evil, Angeles\nDon't start me trying, yeah\nUh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\n'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles\n\n[Verse 3]\nI could make you satisfied in \u0435verything you do\nAll your secret wish\u0435s could right now be coming true\nAnd be forever with my poison arms around you\n\n[Refrain]\nNo one's gonna fool around with us\nNo one's gonna fool around with us\nSo glad to meet you, AngelesYou might also likeEmbed"

        "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks) LyricsThe superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.\n\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.\n\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\n\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\n\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.\n\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\n\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\n\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?\n\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\n\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\n\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\n\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\n\u2014But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\n\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\n\u2014O, sir.\n\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\n\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.\n\nWas that not Mrs M'Guinness?\n\nMrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?\n\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.\n\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.\n\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\n\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.\n\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.\n\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.\n\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\n\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\n\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.\n\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.\n\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\n\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\n\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.\n\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.\n\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.\n\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\n\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.\n\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.\n\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des \u00c9lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\n\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.\n\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.\n\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.\n\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.\n\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.\n\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.\n\nIt was a charming day.\n\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.\n\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\n\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.\n\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.\n\nFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.\n\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.\n\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.\n\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\n\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\n\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.\n\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\n\n\u2014That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\n\n\u2014Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\n\n\u2014It's very close, the constable said.\n\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? he asked.\n\n\u2014I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.\n\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nJ. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.\n\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.\n\nHe halted and growled angrily:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\n\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:\n\n\u2014There, sir.\n\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\n\n\u2014Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\n\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\n\n\u2014They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.\n\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.\n\n\u2014Where did you try? Boody asked.\n\n\u2014M'Guinness's.\n\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\n\n\u2014Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\n\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\n\n\u2014What's in the pot? she asked.\n\n\u2014Shirts, Maggy said.\n\nBoody cried angrily:\n\n\u2014Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\n\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\n\n\u2014And what's in this?\n\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\n\n\u2014Peasoup, Maggy said.\n\n\u2014Where did you get it? Katey asked.\n\n\u2014Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\n\n\u2014Give us it here.\n\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:\n\n\u2014A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?\n\n\u2014Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\n\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\n\n\u2014Our father who art not in heaven.\n\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:\n\n\u2014Boody! For shame!\n\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.\n\nThe blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.\n\n\u2014Put these in first, will you? he said.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\n\n\u2014That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\n\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.\n\nH. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.\n\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.\n\n\u2014Can you send them by tram? Now?\n\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\n\n\u2014O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\n\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\n\n\u2014Will you write the address, sir?\n\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\n\n\u2014Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir. I will, sir.\n\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.\n\n\u2014What's the damage? he asked.\n\nThe blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.\n\n\u2014This for me? he asked gallantly.\n\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, she said.\n\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.\n\n\u2014May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\n\n\u2014Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.\nHe gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.\n\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.\n\n\u2014Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \u00e8 una bestia. \u00c9 peccato. Perch\u00e8 la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.\n\n\u2014Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\n\n\u2014Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.\n\n\u2014Ci rifletter\u00f2, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\n\n\u2014Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.\n\nHis heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\n\n\u2014Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.\n\n\u2014Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.\n\n\u2014Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!\n\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.\n\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.\n\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\n\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.\n\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\n\n\u201416 June 1904.\n\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.\n\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.\n\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\n\n\u2014Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.\n\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\n\n\u2014Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.\n\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\n\n\u2014Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\n\n\u2014Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.\n\nThe vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.\n\n\u2014How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?\n\n\u2014No, Ned.\n\n\u2014He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\n\n\u2014That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.\n\n\u2014If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...\n\n\u2014Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.\n\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\n\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...\n\n\u2014You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\n\n\u2014Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\n\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.\n\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\n\n\u2014The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.\n\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\n\u2014I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.\n\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.\n\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\n\n\u2014Woa, sonny!\n\nHe turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:\n\n\u2014Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\n\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.\n\n\u2014Chow! he said. Blast you!\n\n\u2014The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.\n\n\u2014No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...\n\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...\n\n\u2014I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!\n\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.\n\n\u2014See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\n\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.\n\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.\n\n\u2014See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?\n\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\n\n\u2014Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.\n\n\u2014See? Tom Rochford said.\n\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.\n\n\u2014I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.\n\n\u2014Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.\n\n\u2014Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin\n\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\n\n\u2014But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\n\n\u2014Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\n\nHe followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\n\n\u2014He's a hero, he said simply.\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.\n\n\u2014Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\n\nThey passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\n\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.\n\n\u2014The act of a hero, he said.\n\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.\n\n\u2014This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?\n\nM'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.\n\n\u2014After three, he said. Who's riding her?\n\n\u2014O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\n\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.\n\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.\n\n\u2014Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.\n\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014There he is, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.\n\n\u2014Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.\n\nLenehan laughed.\n\n\u2014I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.\n\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.\n\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\n\n\u2014There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\n\n\u2014Did she? Lenehan said.\n\nA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.\n\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...\n\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\n\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\n\n\u2014I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?\n\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\n\n\u2014The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.\n\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\n\n\u2014I'm weak, he gasped.\n\nM'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.\n\n\u2014He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.\n\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\n\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\n\n\u2014That I had, he said, pushing it by.\n\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\n\n\u2014Them are two good ones, he said.\n\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\n\nOn O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\n\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\n\nHe opened it. Thought so.\n\nA woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\n\nNo: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.\n\nHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.\n\nHe read where his finger opened.\n\n\u2014All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!\n\nYes. This. Here. Try.\n\n\u2014Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabill\u00e9.\n\nYes. Take this. The end.\n\n\u2014You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\n\nMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.\n\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!\n\nYoung! Young!\n\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.\n\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\n\nMr Bloom beheld it.\n\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\n\n\u2014I'll take this one.\n\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\n\n\u2014Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.\n\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\n\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\n\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\n\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.\n\n\u2014It's time for you, she said.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!\n\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?\n\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.\n\n\u2014Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\n\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\n\n\u2014Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\n\n\u2014Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.\n\n\u2014You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\n\n\u2014How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\n\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.\n\n\u2014I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\n\n\u2014I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.\n\nHe handed her a shilling.\n\n\u2014See if you can do anything with that, he said.\n\n\u2014I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\n\n\u2014Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.\n\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\n\n\u2014Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\n\u2014Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\n\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:\n\n\u2014Bang!\n\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\n\n\u2014Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.\n\n\u2014You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\n\n\u2014I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.\n\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\n\n\u2014Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\n\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\n\n\u2014I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.\n\n\u2014You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\n\n\u2014Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.\n\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\n\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.\n\n\u2014I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\n\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\n\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:\n\n\u2014The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!\n\nFrom the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.\n\nI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact.\n\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.\n\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.\n\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.\n\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\n\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.\n\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.\n\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.\n\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.\n\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.\n\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.\n\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\n\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\n\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\n\nDamn good gin that was.\n\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.\nAt the siege of Ross did my father fall.\n\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\n\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\n\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!\n\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.\n\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.\n\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\n\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.\n\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.\n\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\n\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.\n\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.\n\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.\n\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\n\n\u2014Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\n\nTattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\u00e9 of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.\n\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.\n\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\n\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:\n\n\u2014Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.\n\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.\n\n\u2014What are you doing here, Stephen?\n\nDilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.\n\nShut the book quick. Don't let see.\n\n\u2014What are you doing? Stephen said.\n\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum.\n\n\u2014What have you there? Stephen asked.\n\n\u2014I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?\n\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.\n\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.\n\n\u2014What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\n\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\n\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\n\n\u2014Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.\n\n\u2014Some, Dilly said. We had to.\n\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\n\nWe.\n\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.\n\nMisery! Misery!\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\n\n\u2014Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\n\n\u2014O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\n\n\u2014With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\n\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.\n\n\u2014I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\n\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\n\n\u2014There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\n\nBen Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\n\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\n\n\u2014Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\n\n\u2014Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\n\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:\n\n\u2014That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?\n\n\u2014Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\n\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\n\n\u2014They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\n\n\u2014Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.\n\n\u2014And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\n\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.\n\n\u2014Aw! he said.\n\n\u2014That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\n\n\u2014What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\n\nHe turned to both.\n\n\u2014That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\n\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.\n\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.\n\n\u2014For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\n\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\n\n\u2014What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?\n\n\u2014He has, Father Cowley said.\n\n\u2014Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\n\n\u2014That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\n\n\u2014You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.\n\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\n\n\u2014Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.\n\n\u2014The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.\n\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\n\n\u2014God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\n\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.\n\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\n\n\u2014Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.\n\n\u2014You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\n\n\u2014Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.\n\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\n\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\n\n\u2014Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\n\n\u2014Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.\n\n\u2014Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\n\n\u2014I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\n\nThey went down Parliament street.\n\n\u2014There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.\n\n\u2014Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\n\nOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.\n\n\u2014The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.\n\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.\n\n\u2014And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.\n\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\n\n\u2014Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.\n\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.\n\n\u2014Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\n\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.\n\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\n\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.\n\n\u2014What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\n\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\n\n\u2014O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\n\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.\n\n\u2014Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.\n\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\n\n\u2014Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\n\n\u2014Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\n\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\n\n\u2014What's that? Martin Cunningham said.\n\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.\n\n\u2014What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.\n\n\u2014The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.\n\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:\n\n\u2014Parnell's brother. There in the corner.\n\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\n\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.\n\n\u2014I'll take a m\u00e9lange, Haines said to the waitress.\n\n\u2014Two m\u00e9langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.\n\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\n\n\u2014We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.\n\nHaines opened his newbought book.\n\n\u2014I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.\n\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\n\n\u2014England expects...\n\nBuck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\n\n\u2014You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.\n\n\u2014I am sure he has an id\u00e9e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.\n\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\n\n\u2014They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...\n\n\u2014Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.\n\nBuck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.\n\n\u2014He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?\n\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\n\n\u2014Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.\n\n\u2014Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.\n\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\n\n\u2014This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.\n\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.\n\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\n\nAt the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:\n\n\u2014Coactus volui.\n\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\n\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.\n\n\u2014God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!\n\nOpposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.\n\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\n\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.\n\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.\n\nNo Sandymount tram.\n\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.\n\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.\n\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\n\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.\n\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cort\u00e8ge:\n\nBut though she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I've a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.\n\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.Embed"
