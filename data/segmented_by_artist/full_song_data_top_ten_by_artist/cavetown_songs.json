            "plain": "\u201cDevil Town\u201d is Cavetown\u2019s eighth track off of his first E.P, \u201ccavetown\u201d. The song follows the trials and tribulations of a young person\u2019s life, exploring themes of Divorce, Anxiety, and Fear \u2013 Experiences many young people can relate to. Also weaved throughout are subtle implications of insanity and mania, and imagery suggests that the young person in question is possibly in some sort of mental asylum: Dressing gowns, forgetting their own name, spiders in shoes, and the actual name of \u201cdevil town\u201d all have connotations commonly associated with mental asylums."

The song follows the trials and tribulations of a young person\u2019s life, exploring themes of Divorce, Anxiety, and Fear \u2013 Experiences many young people can relate to. Also weaved throughout are subtle implications of insanity and mania, and imagery suggests that the young person in question is possibly in some sort of mental asylum: Dressing gowns, forgetting their own name, spiders in shoes, and the actual name of \u201cdevil town\u201d all have connotations commonly associated with mental asylums."

Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs, right?\nBoys will be bugs, right?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm a dumb teen boy\nAll I wanna do is quit\nMy mum told me that she's worried\nAnd I couldn't give a shit\nI have friends who understand me\nTheir names are spider, beetle, bee\nThey don't say much but\nThey have always listened to me\nSee Cavetown LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like[Verse 4]\nThe other boys at school\nThink it's cool to hate your parents\nBut they're lying all the time\nThe bugs advised that I should let 'em\nAnd if you wanna cry\nMake sure that they never see it\nOr even better yet\nBlock it out and never feel it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI just turned fourteen\nAnd I think I know everything\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\nAin't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs, right?\nBoys will be bugs, right?\n\n[Bridge]\nJust turned fourteen\nAnd I think this year I'm gonna be mean\n(Just turned fourteen)\n(And I think I know everything)\nJust turned fourteen\nAnd I think this year I'm gonna be mean\n(Just turned fourteen)\n(And I think the world revolves around me)\n[Chorus]\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\nAin't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs, right?\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\nAin't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs, right?\n\n[Outro]\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\nAin't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs, right?48Embed"

Sometimes I think I'm dead\n'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head\nBut I don't wanna fall asleep just yet\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nMy eyes went dark\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nI don't know where\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nMy pupils are\nBut I'll figure out a way to get us out of here\n\n[Bridge]\nGet a load of this monster\nHe doesn't know how to communicate\nHis mind is in a different place\nWill everybody please give him a little bit of space?\nGet a load of this train wreck\nHis hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet\nBut little do we know, the stars\nWelcome him with open arms\nOh\nSee Cavetown LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like[Outro]\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nTime is\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nSlowly\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nTracing his face\nBut strangely he feels at home in this place81Embed"

Sometimes I think I'm dead\n'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head\nBut I don't wanna fall asleep just yet\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nMy eyes went dark\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nI don't know where\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nMy pupils are\nBut I'll figure out a way to get us out of here\n\n[Bridge]\nGet a load of this monster\nHe doesn't know how to communicate\nHis mind is in a different place\nWill everybody please give him a little bit of space?\nGet a load of this train wreck\nHis hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet\nBut little do we know, the stars\nWelcome him with open...\nGet a load of this monster\nHe doesn't know how to communicate\nHis mind is in a different place\nWill everybody please give him a little bit of space?\nGet a load of this train wreck\nHis hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet\nBut little do we know, the stars\nWelcome him with open arms\nOoh-ooh\nSee Cavetown LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like[Outro]\nTime is\nSlowly\nTracing his face\nBut strangely he feels at home in this place16Embed"

The calming tune combines Cavetown\u2019s smooth vocals, melancholic, and nostalgic lyrics with a feeling of youthful love, but the lyrics tell a different story. By the end of the song, he passes his stages of grief from depression to acceptance. He fully takes in the fact that the relationship was toxic and eventually becomes more aware how much it was hurting him."

In this song Robin describes feelings of inadequacy and needing to please the other person, as well as contrasting the positive imagery of things like \u201csugar\u201d and \u201choneydew\u201d with a semantic field of gory imagery like \u201ccavity\u201d, \u201ccardiac\u201d, \u201cskin\u201d, \u201cveins\u201d, \u201cfeeling sick\u201d, etc. This juxtaposition creates an uncomfortable feeling that this love interest might not be all good."

While scribbling, she tears the book page because she\u2019s so full of rage. I think that he added this \u201ceaster egg\u201d to get Chloe\u2019s music more recognized.

Whenever this Post-Chorus is delivered, the song slows and quiets down, offering more focus and meaning to these words. It\u2019s as if Robbie is breaking out of his persona for a moment to say outright how he feels. The repetition of \u201cSay it back\u201d is a possible allusion to the fear he holds of losing his partner, and what he would be without them.\nWhile he holds himself in low regards, Robbie holds his partner very highly, and they make him happy. His partner\u2019s praise and reassurance may also be compensating for the lack of positivity Robbie gives himself, and so, the uncertainty of knowing whether or not his partner really does feel that way brings with it an uncertainty that Robbie will have a positive influence in his life.\nAnother thing of importance to note is the word choice of \u2018like\u2019 rather than \u2018love\u2019, and the fact that Robbie is asking this question even though his partner has told him already that they love him. This again ties back to Robbie\u2019s self-doubt, especially Verse 1\u2019s line on finding it hard to understand his partner\u2019s perspective \u2013 essentially, it may be easier for Robbie to understand that his partner likes him before understanding that they love him."
