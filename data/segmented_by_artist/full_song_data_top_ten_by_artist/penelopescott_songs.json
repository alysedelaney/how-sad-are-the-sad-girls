              "I think this is a hint that Penelope is not really missing what she got out of the relationship so much as just the fact that being in a relationship made her feel loved and like she had self worth, or that possibly some things had happened in the relationship that really changed her in a negative way, going from an \u201cawkward teenage virgin\u201d who laughs in bed (pretty clearly a past version of herself since Penelope is 21 and implies she and this lover slept together by her repeated references to being in bed with them) to crying or feeling nothing in bed. It raises the possibility to me at least that this relationship may not have been a healthy, happy one or may have been extremely unstable before ending but that Penelope struggles with moving on from it bc she doesn\u2019t love herself and without the reminder that someone else loves her at least enough to stay with her she feels lost and worthless. This ties into her previous line about being \u201creally fucking selfish, and really fucking lost\u201d; she knows this wasn\u2019t good for her or her lover, but wanted to cling to it bc she based her whole worth on it. It actually reminds me a lot of my own experiences with a relationship that was emotionally supportive but physically and sexually abusive, where I allowed myself to be scarred and mistreated bc my self esteem was so bad and my need for an emotional outlet was so great I was terrified of being left by someone who hurt me and made me miserable but lovebombed the hell out of me\u2026 particularly bc \u201cfeeling nothing in bed\u201d both physically and emotionally is a coping mechanism that a lot of people, myself included, use to survive sexual trauma and can make it extremely difficult to move on and find happiness alone or with a new lover. You feel like a part of you is completely broken and like you\u2019ll never experience the joy sex brought you before the trauma, or be able to really give your full self to another lover again."

UwU and OwO originate from Hentai but are often associated with Furry Culture. UwU and OwO are usually included in furry roleplay or media mocking such things. These emoticons and be inherently sexual or can be just used in everyday speech. UwU represents closed eyes and OwO represents open ones. Both can be written in uppercase (UwU, OwO) or lowercase (uwu, owo).\n\nThe use of UwU in this song can also be connected with the usage of the word ahegao and the way the first line is written and spoken. \u2018UwU\u2019 is often connected with anime-esque online culture. Talking in a baby voice is often associated with cuteness or anime in general in online communities.

It all connects to the aheago aswell, because aheago faces are most commonly used in anime and manga, looping back around to the online anime, hentai, and manga communities."
