The track was released alongside it\u2019s music video on March 1st, 2023 without  prior announcement.\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone, Phoebe Bridgers said about the song\u2019s lyrical content,\n\nBeing like, \u2018I\u2019m not strong enough to show up for you. I can\u2019t be the partner that you want me to be.\u2019 But also being like, \u2018I\u2019m too fucked up. I\u2019m unknowable in some deep way!\u2019 Self-hatred is a god complex sometimes, where you think you\u2019re the most fucked-up person who\u2019s ever lived. Straight up, you\u2019re not. And it can make people behave really selfishly, and I love each of our interpretations of that concept.\u201d"

The track was released alongside it\u2019s music video on March 1st, 2023 without  prior announcement.\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone, Phoebe Bridgers said about the song\u2019s lyrical content,\n\nBeing like, \u2018I\u2019m not strong enough to show up for you. I can\u2019t be the partner that you want me to be.\u2019 But also being like, \u2018I\u2019m too fucked up. I\u2019m unknowable in some deep way!\u2019 Self-hatred is a god complex sometimes, where you think you\u2019re the most fucked-up person who\u2019s ever lived. Straight up, you\u2019re not. And it can make people behave really selfishly, and I love each of our interpretations of that concept.\u201d"

The song is led by Phoebe Bridgers and features backing vocals by Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus.\n\nIn an upcoming interview, the band told Rolling Stone that Bridgers first sent her bandmates \u201cEmily I\u2019m Sorry\u201d right after Punisher was released, asking, \u201cCan we be a band again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all nervous to bring it up,\u201d Bridgers says. \u201cWe all thought that we were more excited than the other person.\u201d\n\nThe song is most likely about Emily Bannon, a voiceover actor and vocal artist who was rumored to be involved in a polyamorous relationship with both Phoebe and producer Chris Nelson in 2018, and then in a monogamous relationship with Phoebe after they and Chris split up in 2019. Emily referenced her relationship with Phoebe in a 2020 Thanksgiving Instagram reel, stating that Phoebe has \u201cfigur[ed] in to every single polycule i\u2019ve been in in the past 10 years.\u201d She also appears in the \u201cKyoto\u201d music video."

The song is led by Phoebe Bridgers and features backing vocals by Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus.\n\nIn an upcoming interview, the band told Rolling Stone that Bridgers first sent her bandmates \u201cEmily I\u2019m Sorry\u201d right after Punisher was released, asking, \u201cCan we be a band again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all nervous to bring it up,\u201d Bridgers says. \u201cWe all thought that we were more excited than the other person.\u201d\n\nThe song is most likely about Emily Bannon, a voiceover actor and vocal artist who was rumored to be involved in a polyamorous relationship with both Phoebe and producer Chris Nelson in 2018, and then in a monogamous relationship with Phoebe after they and Chris split up in 2019. Emily referenced her relationship with Phoebe in a 2020 Thanksgiving Instagram reel, stating that Phoebe has \u201cfigur[ed] in to every single polycule i\u2019ve been in in the past 10 years.\u201d She also appears in the \u201cKyoto\u201d music video."

Nelson and Bannon eventually broke up around the fall of 2019 but Bridgers and Bannon continued their relationship together.\n\nSoon after the break up, Bridgers posted a statement on Instagram in support of Bannon writing, \u201cI witnessed and can personally verify much of the abuse (grooming, stealing, violence) perpetuated by Chris Nelson. This post prompted Nelson to sue Bridgers for attempting to \u201cdestroy\u201d his reputation and defame him on social media, according to that original September 2021 lawsuit. Nelson then pressed charges on Bridgers for \u201cfalse and misleading statements\" and attempted to sue Bridgers for $3.8 million. Bridgers filed to strike the lawsuit and doubled down on her support of Bannon in the filing.\n\nEventually the $3.8 million defamation lawsuit was dismissed as Bridgers filed dismissal request which citied California\u2019s anti-SLAPP laws \u2014 which aim to block a plaintiff from using arduous litigation to intimidate people out of their rights to exercise free speech."

Julien Baker takes the reins in \u201c$20\u201d, initially written outside of the group.\n\nWith soft punky vibes and scattered harmonies, Baker leads, with bandmates Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus finishing her sentences. As the song ends, overlapping vocals create a chaotic soundscape before Bridgers screams her heart out.\n\n\u201c$20\u201d may be inspired by  another Baker-penned boygenius song, in which she sings,\n\nDreamcatcher on the rearview mirror\nHasn\u2019t caught a thing yet\nTwenty dollars and a souvenir\nAnything\u2019s worth trying"

Julien Baker takes the reins in \u201c$20\u201d, initially written outside of the group.\n\nWith soft punky vibes and scattered harmonies, Baker leads, with bandmates Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus finishing her sentences. As the song ends, overlapping vocals create a chaotic soundscape before Bridgers screams her heart out.\n\n\u201c$20\u201d may be inspired by  another Baker-penned boygenius song, in which she sings,\n\nDreamcatcher on the rearview mirror\nHasn\u2019t caught a thing yet\nTwenty dollars and a souvenir\nAnything\u2019s worth trying"

While Bridgers had previously dated singer/songwriter/abuser Ryan Adams who helped record her debut record Killer, it is possible she is referring to him in these lines \u2014 how he not only helped her breakthrough into the industry, but also put her in the limelight while the two were dating."

              "Expressing love through the purchase of material goods can sometimes be used as a stand-in for a variety of emotions. Have you ever been on a trip and found something that instantly makes you think of someone in you life that you have a complicated relationship with, so you purchase it? Or maybe you\u2019ve been on a trip and needed to purchase an item for someone so they feel loved but you don\u2019t find anything meaningful and you buy them a random trinket? Either way, the situation is emotionally fraught and difficult to navigate.\n\nIn this song\u2019s context, I find it more likely that a variation of the second proposed options is true. \u201cSouvenir\u201d\u2019s first verse, by Julien Baker, appears to be about being away from someone who is obligatory in your life and buying them a souvenir to placate their worry. When someone struggles with personal afflictions like substance abuse, addiction, suicidality, depression, or trauma, it can leave those surrounding that person with an ever-present sense of worry. A token knick-knack may be seen as a compromise showing progress to the worried party, making them express less outward concern or doubt. The last 2 stanza\u2019s (\u201cAlways end up dying/ You said because of course I did\u201d) are demonstrative of this sentiment because they imply that the possibly transactional nature of buying a souvenir to prove well-being can be a defense mechanism against legitimate concern.\n\nHaving poor mental health and being close to others can be hard because it can inspire guilt, especially when mistakes are made. Julien\u2019s verse attempts to illustrate these difficulties and the ensuing guilt."

Baker states in the third and fourth lines that the souvenir dream catcher was twenty dollars, which is a steep price, but that \u201canything\u2019s worth trying\u201d to kick the bad dreams she\u2019s been experiencing."

What they could be looking at is the depression itself. An ugly thing, that the speaker wishes was not there. Of course, the speaker could also be identifying with the disease and hates that is so much a part of their identity."

              "Although Phoebe states that she\u2019s unsure why she always ends up moving in next to cemeteries and hospitals, her implication could be that she fixates on the morbid, or that her head is often in a dark place.\n\nThere is an implication that Phoebe (or Julien or Lucy) is always in danger of dying or being seriously hurt, and her subconscious puts her where there\u2019s minimum effort. One can presume that this is an allusion to suicide or self harm. On top of that, the mention of a graveyard next door, where dead people are buried, before a hospital further away, where injured people are healed, implies that death is a much more attractive and relevant reality than somehow surviving through an incident.\nThe last line I gives the vibe that the whole verse is a \u201cget to know me\u201d intro paragraph on a dating website, and that subtle humour just adds layers to an already clever verse.\n\nPhoebe also mentions living by hospitals on her song \u201cHalloween\u201d:\n\nI hate living by the hospital\nThe sirens go all night\nI used to joke that if they woke you up\nSomebody better be dying"

Hence, \u201cyou take and you take\u201d, and \u201cyou unrelentingly ask for the secret\u201d.\n\nTLDR; boygenius are pointing out that some secrets ought to stay secret."

As punishment, God cursed Cain to a life of wandering, before settling to build a city where he bore his son, Enoch. In the extra-biblical Book of Enoch, it describes the soul of Abel as \u201cchief of martyrs, crying for vengeance, for the destruction of the seed of Cain.\u201d Cain\u2019s lineage would later end after five generations. Baker is likely comparing her suffering to that of Cain\u2019s family, cursed by God."

Conversely, once the group members make it back home after touring for a while, they spend such a short time at home before leaving for tour again, not having adequate time to properly feel at home.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Lucy Dacus explained the meaning behind the chorus:\n\n[\u2026] then we brought in the chorus about never really being anywhere when you\u2019re on tour because you don\u2019t ever get to see any of the places that you go.

She connects that to being outside of reality by feeling like life is more like a video game to her in this state, and that she is outside of that world."

By saying she\u2019ll never come up again, Baker could be trying to represent a sort of spiritual death\u2013permanent separation from God, forever surrounded by her sins in the dirty water.\n\nThis entire verse also echoes the ending of the popular video game Bioshock: Infinite.\n\nSPOILER ALERT\n\nAt the end of Bioshock: Infinite, the hero of the game learns that he is also the villain of the game, as he has been fighting a version of himself from an alternate timeline, and in order to save the world, he allows himself to be drowned in a Baptism-like ceremony. This carries the video game theme into the bridge, where there are even more direct video game references."
