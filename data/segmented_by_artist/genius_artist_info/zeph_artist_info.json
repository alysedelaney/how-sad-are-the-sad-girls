      "plain": "Zephani Jong, known artistically as Zeph, is a singer, songwriter, and producer from Maryland. Her initial popularity may have started with her viral post-it note drawings of Vines, but she quickly proved that there was much more to her than this. In 2018 she released her song Forever & Always, and followed this in 2020 with Lucky and Ways to Go. Her EP goodnight moon was full of short instrumentals along with heartbreakingly beautiful song demos. While her catalog on streaming services may seem limited, she constantly produces \u201clittle songs\u201d on her Instagram and Youtube accounts, spanning various relatable topics and diverse genres."
