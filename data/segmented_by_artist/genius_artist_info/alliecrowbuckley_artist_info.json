      "plain": "Allie Crow Buckley\u2019s music is of the high-lonesome, Pacific variety \u2013 a product of her lifelong love of sounds she heard in her roving family\u2019s many homes. Born in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco in \u201993, the Pacific Ocean has always been her backyard. Her twenty-five years have been spent in Mendocino, New Zealand, Venice Beach, and Malibu, the strange beach town on the edge of Los Angeles where she wrote the songs you hear today."
