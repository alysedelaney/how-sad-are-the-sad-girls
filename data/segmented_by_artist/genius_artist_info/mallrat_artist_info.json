      "plain": "Grace Shaw a.k.a Mallrat is an Australian singer-songwriter from Brisbane, Australia. Her stage name is derived from the song  \u201cMallrats (La La La)\u201d by The Orwells.\n\nMallrat recorded her debut EP Uninvited while still in high school.\n\nA woman whose style mixes indie, acoustic leaning pop and heavy synth/electro pop elements, Mallrat\u2019s rise to Australian popularity was quite fast. She racked up millions of streams on singles \u201cUnivited\u201d and \u201cFor Real\u201d (the latter of which was featured in a Google ad). Then a year later, performed at major Australian festival Splendour in the Grass. She eventually signed to Dew Process in Australia and Nettwerk Music Group internationally.\n\nThe end of 2017 also saw her release \u201cBetter\u201d, before releasing \u201cUFO\u201d featuring Allday in 2018, which both experienced similar success. They were featured on her sophomore EP In The Sky . Third single \u201cGroceries\u201d was an even bigger success for Mallrat, as it reached #7 in the annual Hottest 100, and was included on some publications' year end best lists.\n\nHer debut album, Butterfly Blue, is expected for release in May 2022."
