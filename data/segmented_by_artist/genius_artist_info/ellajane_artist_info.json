      "plain": "Raised on the scripture of Billie Holiday, Carole King, and her namesake, Ella Fitzgerald, music was always a part of ella jane\u2019s destiny. Having played piano since she was four, and written her own songs since age eleven, she never wasted any time vaulting toward it.\n\nHer debut EP, THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!, was released September 10th, 2021, via FADER Label. Comprised entirely of material ella wrote in high school prior to her viral success  the EP traces a period of self-discovery with incisive wisdom and whimsy."
