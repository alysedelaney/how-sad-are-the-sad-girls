      "plain": "Becca Harvey was working as a cashier at an East Atlanta bakery when the coronavirus pandemic forced her out of work. With an abundance of idle time, she set about finishing the music she had begun writing under the moniker girlpuppy a year earlier, and by the middle of May, For You \u2014 a breezy, soft-focus love song she wrote with her multi-instrumentalist boyfriend \u2014 found its way onto playlists and into the ears of thousands of listeners. \u2028 It didn\u2019t take long for Harvey, only a few months shy of 22, to follow up on her success. A breakup shortly after For You\u2019s release unleashed a font of new music: downcast, lovelorn songs aided by production from Marshall Vore, a close friend of Harvey\u2019s and collaborator of fellow emo-folk darling Phoebe Bridgers. The new music, written during one whirlwind pandemic summer with the same vivid, Swift-ian lyricism that helped launch For You into relevance, will make up Harvey\u2019s forthcoming EP, titled Swan. Swan will release on August 20th via Royal Mountain Records.\n - via Spotify"
