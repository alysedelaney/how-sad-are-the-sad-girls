      "plain": "No filters, no Facetune, no Vsco, no makeup, no bullshit. What you see is what you get with 21-year-old singer-songwriter Rosie. \u201cI want to be transparent. Everything is exactly as it appears,\u201d she says. \u201cThe scale of emotions that everyone feels is such a spectrum. The bad days are equally as important as the good days.\n\nSeeking to create a safe place online and through her music, Rosie\u2019s willingness to get real struck a chord with millions. Her stripped back breakup ballad, \u201cNever the 1\u201d, amassed over 15 million views on TikTok highlighting Rosie\u2019s songwriting prowess.\n\nThe clever, heart wrenching lyrics and Rosie\u2019s soothing vocal performance atop a gentle piano instrumental captivated an audience who\u2019ve adopted the song for their own catharsis.\n\nThe New York native has an uncanny ability to turn negative experiences like loss, betrayal, and criticism into jetpack fueled motivation. An, environmentalist, mental health advocate, guitarist, vocal producer, songwriter, and now major label recording artist, Rosie\u2019s achievements come from her undaunted resilience \u2013 a retaliation against life\u2019s harder realities.\n\nRaised in a musical family, Rosie began writing songs at age 12 and credits her parents and brother as her biggest supporters. Signing to Arista Records this fall, Rosie prepares for her next challenge \u2013 the release of her debut EP. Having written 90 songs for the project, it\u2019s no telling where her insatiable resolve and open heart will take her next."
