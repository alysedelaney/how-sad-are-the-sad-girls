      "plain": "Stella Rose Bennett (born 30 January 2000), known professionally as BENEE (formerly Bene), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter who debuted in December 2017 with \u201cTough Guy.\u201d Music had always been part of her life, with a family history in theatre. BENEE\u2019s first instrument was a saxophone, playing it for several years, along with the guitar.\n\nBENEE started posting music to Soundcloud in her final year of high school (2017), catching the attention of producer Josh Fountain. The pair went on the work together in several of her singles, including break-out single \u201cSoaked\u201d which was featured on triple j\u2019s hottest 100 (2018).\n\nAfter spending two weeks in a communications course at the Auckland Institute of Technology, Benee realised she wanted to be making music full-time.\n\nFinding her moniker was a struggle, as she explained to Neck Of The Woods:\n\nI needed something that stood out but was personal as well. So it\u2019s simply just part of a nickname that I\u2019ve always had spelt differently which is taken from my last name. Turns out it also means well and good in Latin which is kinda funky.\n\nBENEE\u2019s debut single, FIRE ON MARZZ was released in June 2019, and featured four previously released singles, alongside two new tracks. This was followed by a second EP, in November 2020, which included a feature from tourmate Jack Berry and American musician Gus Dapperton.\n\nHer song \u201cSupalonely\u201d went viral on Tiktok in March 2020, becoming BENEE\u2019s first song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #39.\n\nIn May 2020, BENEE released a second version of the song, without Gus, titled \u201cLownely\u201d and offering a more stripped back production. A month later, BENEE joined forces with Bakar and Kenny Beats to create \u201cNight Garden\u201d. The track was debuted on Apple Music in celebration of BENEE being named as their Up Next artist of the month."
