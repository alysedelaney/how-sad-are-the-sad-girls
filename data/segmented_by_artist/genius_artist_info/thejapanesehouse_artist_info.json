      "plain": "Amber Bain is the 25-year old London based face and name behind the solo project, experimenting with alternative pop, dreamlike creativity, and brooding, futuristic sentiments. Her sounds have also been described as \u201ca spellbinding slice of electropop that likely counts James Blake and SOHN as influences.\u201d She spoke to BBC Radio 1 about how the composition of her voice becomes a combination of harmonies in her songs, citing Bon Iver and Fleetwood Mac as earnest inspirations and favorites.\n\nThe first single, \u201cPools To Bathe In,\u201d was released in March of 2015 as the title track for an EP entirely produced by Bain, as well as Matthew Healy and George Daniel, members of The 1975. Both acts are signed to Dirty Hit Records from West London.\n\nIn September of 2015, \u201cClean\u201d was released as the title track for a forthcoming EP, due for release in November. The song premiered on Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe as the World Record of the day, along with a music video release.\n\n2016 saw the release of the band\u2019s third EP, Swim Against The Tide, which came following the release of two singles: \u201cFace Like Thunder\u201d and \u201cGood Side In\u201d. In 2017, their fourth EP saw the light of day. Saw You in a Dream saw release after three of its four tracks were released as singles, including the titular track."
