      "plain": "Leith Ross started making music as a way to digest their own life. They know the power of music as a force for good: \u201cI was sitting in my basement bedroom, thinking about a girl that I had a crush on, feeling alone and scared and ashamed of myself. Then a song came on about two girls in love. I was so thrilled.\u201d\n\nHoping to give that gift to someone else, Ross penned an incredibly honest and intimate collection of songs inspired by artists including Feist and Phoebe Bridgers. Originally from a small town near Ottawa, Ross, the 21 year old Humber College graduate, collaborated with some fellow students to record the debut EP, Motherwell. The eight song collection was recorded live-off-the floor in a single afternoon \u2013 what you hear is what you get."
