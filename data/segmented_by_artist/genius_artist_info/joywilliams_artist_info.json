      "plain": "With four Grammy Awards under her belt, this American singer-songwriter is no stranger to the stage. Williams has released four solo albums and four EPs since 2001 and was part of the folk-rock duo The Civil Wars from 2009-2014. Upon dissolution of the band, she went on to forge her own path, commenting on her independent nature in a  2014 interview:\n\nI wanted to write things that moved me and not feel like I had any parameters telling me what to do or not do."
