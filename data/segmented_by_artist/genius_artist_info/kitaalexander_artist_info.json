      "plain": "Australian surfer girl Kita Alexander quit school when she discovered she could make sufficient money by playing pubs. The Brisbane-born, Port Macquarie-raised singer/songwriter used Google to find a manager, who went on to connect her with producers for Lana Del Ray and fellow Aussies Sia and Empire of the Sun. Her influences (Fleetwood Mac, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Tom Petty, Patti Smith) informed much for her sonic aesthetic, while polished production sheen enhanced her pop sensibilities.\nAlexander released her first single My Own Way and signed with Atlantic Records in 2015 and then went on to released her EP, Like You want To which was released in late 2015 and featured the eponymous single."
