      "plain": "P.S. Eliot was a pop punk band formed in 2007 in Birmingham, Alabama by twin sisters Katie (guitars, vocals) and Allison Crutchfield (drums). They released two albums: Introverted Romance In Our Troubled Minds (2009) and Sadie (2011), both on Salinas Records. After the band broke up in 2011, both members pursued their own musical projects\u2013Katie started Waxahatchee and Allison started Swearin'.\nTheir name is probably a wordplay on T. S. Eliot, a British poet considered \u201cone of the twentieth century\u2019s major poets\u201d."
