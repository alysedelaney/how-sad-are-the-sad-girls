      "plain": "Tirzah Mastin, simply known as Tirzah or Taz, is a British singer-songwriter based in London.\n\nShe grew up in Essex and attended the prestigious Purcell School for Young Musicians in Watford, England, where she studied harp. There she met Mica Levi, aka Micachu, who became her friend and musical partner.\n\nHowever, she felt constrained by the school\u2019s intensive program (\u00abI didn\u2019t get a sense of freedom or creativity about it,\u00bb she says), and after graduation she chose instead to study textiles at the London College of Fashion.\n\nShe continued to make music with Micachu for fun, and they started releasing it in the early 2010s. Her debut album, Devotion, was released in 2018.\n\nTirzah is engaged with producer Kwes (aka Kwake Bass) and gave birth to their daughter Jocelyn in november 2017. She\u2019s also a full-time designer at a print agency."
