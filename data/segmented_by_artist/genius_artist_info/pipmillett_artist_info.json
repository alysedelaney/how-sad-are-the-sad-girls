      "plain": "Manchester-born singer-songwriter Pip Millett has taken the UK by storm with her chilled, emotional fusion of R&B and soul.\n\nHer love affair with music began during her school days when she received guitar lessons as a present from her mum, before moving to London to study music.\n\nPip\u2019s early releases including \u2018Make Me Cry\u2019 and \u2018Talk About It\u2019 have earned her many fans, including contemporaries like Jorja Smith.\n\nShe released her Motion Sick EP in August 2021."
