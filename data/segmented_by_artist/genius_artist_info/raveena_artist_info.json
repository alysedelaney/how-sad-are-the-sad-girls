      "plain": "Raveena Aurora is an Indian American singer-songwriter from New York City. She is known for her dreamlike and sensual 70\u2019s and 90\u2019s R&B / soul-influenced style. Her debut EP Shanti was released in 2017. She frequently collaborates with Everett Orr.\n\nShe often advocates on behalf of women of color through her music. In an interview with Girlboss, she said:\n\nMy biggest goal in life is to help other people (especially women of color) heal and feel more empowered, artistically and spiritually in tune. I want to connect with them through my music, but also in a broader way as an artist, lover and healer. Also making records that are timeless, interesting and well-made fuels a lot of my drive. I still have a ways to go at both of those things, so getting closer to those goals definitely inspire me."
