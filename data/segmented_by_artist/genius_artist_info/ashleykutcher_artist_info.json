      "plain": "Ashley Kutcher is a 22 year old pop artist from Baltimore, Maryland. She started performing in high school and releasing her own music during college. Over the past year Ashley has gained a larger fanbase than she ever thought possible. She released her single titled \u201cLove You From a Distance\u201d and it gained over one million Spotify plays in just two weeks. In college, Ashley began to play live music and produce songs on the side as she pursed a four year long nursing degree. She has always wanted to help people and that\u2019s why she chose nursing. Recently, Ashley said that she felt she was able to help way more people through her music. With much recent success, Ashley became aware that she was finally able to solely focus on music and develop her passion into a career. While Ashley will graduate in 2020 with a BSN/RN degree, she has decided after graduating to leave nursing behind for now to pursue her artist career full time."
