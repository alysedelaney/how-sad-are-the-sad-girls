      "plain": "Hello everyone my name is Lexi! I\u2019m 19 and my favorite thing is to express my feelings through my music. I\u2019ve been writing and singing since I can remember and it\u2019s always been such a huge part of my life. 2021 was a crazy year for me, I signed with a label, released my first EP, and went on tour. But my life took a twist in August when I went through a really tough breakup (my first love). The last few months I spent every day in the studio writing about what I\u2019ve been going through and tbh writing these songs was therapy for me and was the reason I was able to get through the pain. But as hard as my situation was, I believe this happened to me so I could be a voice for those who may be going through something similar. I feel so lucky that I get to express myself through my music and put it out into the world. Anyway, this next project is the best music I\u2019ve ever made! It\u2019s raw, real, honest, vulnerable, and tells my story. I\u2019m so excited for you all to hear it. I could SCREAM!!! Thank you to each and every one of you for being a part of my journey. xo"
