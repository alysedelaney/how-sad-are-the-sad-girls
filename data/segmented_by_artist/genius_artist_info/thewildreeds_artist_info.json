      "plain": "The Wild Reeds is an American alt-country/folk trio based in Los Angeles comprising Sharon Silva, Kinsey Lee, and Mackenzie Howe.\n\nThough all three singers are also songwriters, they are seldom individually credited. The reason for this is addressed in this quote by Silva: \u201cWe\u2019re vessels for the songs. We don\u2019t claim ownership.\u201d\n\nThe trio switches up instruments onstage \u2013 acoustic guitars, fuzzed-out electrics, harmonium, banjo, Nord keyboard, harmonica \u2013 and toured with other members on bass guitar and drums (Nick Phakpiseth and Nick Jones, respectively)."
