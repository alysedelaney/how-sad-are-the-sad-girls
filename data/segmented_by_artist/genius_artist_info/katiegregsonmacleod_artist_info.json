      "plain": "Scottish singer-songwriter Katie Gregson-MacLeod has released her new EP \u2018songs written for piano\u2019 and shared the video for latest single \u2018white lies\u2019 \u2013 check out both below.\n\nThe new five-track EP from the rising artist includes breakout track \u2018complex\u2019 along with a live version recorded with a 12-piece string ensemble, in addition to three new tracks.\n\nNew single \u2018white lies\u2019, co-written with Matt Maltese, also arrives today (December 2) with a new video.\n\n\u201cI had the idea for this body of work really early on into the process of \u2018complex\u2019 being released and all the craziness around it, \u201d the singer said of her second EP in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to release a stripped back acoustic EP and when \u2018complex\u2019 \u2013 a song released in demo form first with just piano and vocal \u2013 resonated with so many people I felt it was a perfect opportunity to release a body of work that fell within that world sonically and thematically.\u201d\n\nNew single \u2018white lies\u2019 tells the story of \u201cgrowing apart from someone\u201d you once loved, according to a press release. The video finds the singer watching an older couple in love from the sidelines, unable to help herself from the allure of an old-fashioned romance.\n\n\u201cI wanted to talk about the feeling of growing apart from someone you\u2019d not long ago yearned for,\u201d the singer said of the emotive new single. \u201cThis is the most recent song on the EP and at the time of writing, I\u2019d been experiencing so many changes to my own life and was the busiest I\u2019d ever been.\n\n\u201cIn that process I guess I was feeling detached from my feelings for this person. So when I went in to write with Matt Maltese, the main question that arose was around whether that feeling was a natural result of slowly growing apart or if I had just been really successful at distracting myself.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI was really chuffed to be writing with Matt, someone I\u2019d looked up to as a writer for a long time, to the point where I didn\u2019t even realise how special the song was until Matt sent over the first demo. We\u2019d just met that day but it was such an honest writing process and the song was finished really quickly. It\u2019s definitely one of my favourite songs I\u2019ve written.\u201d\n\nIn September this year, Gregson-MacLeod signed to Columbia Records after amassing 100,000 views on her 45-second TikTok clip.\n\nAfter posting \u2018Complex\u2019 to the app with the caption \u201chere\u2019s my saviour complex\u201d on August 5, the singer woke up the next day to comments from Gracie Abrams, Lennon Stella, and Maisie Peters.\n - NME"
