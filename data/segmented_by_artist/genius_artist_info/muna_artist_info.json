      "plain": "MUNA is an American pop/rock trio, composed of lead vocalist Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin, and Naomi McPherson. All three members are multi-instrumentalists and producers. They all met while at University of Southern California, and all identify as queer.\n\nIn an interview with Stereogum, the band explained that their name was chosen after weeks of trying to find a fitting band name, and that \u201c[i]t was a surprise in the same way that the music we made was surprising.\u201d\n\nTheir debut album About U was released in February 2017 on RCA Records. In late 2019, they released their sophomore album, Saves the World."
