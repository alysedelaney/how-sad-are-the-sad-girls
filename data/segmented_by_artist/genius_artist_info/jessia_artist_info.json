      "plain": "She\u2019ll make you laugh. She\u2019ll let you cry. She\u2019ll remind you it gets better. It\u2019s why she has emerged as one of 2021\u2019s most inspiring breakout artists with 30 million streams, 50 million views, and countless TikTok creations in less than a month. Championed by Grammy award winning singer, songwriter, and producer Ryan Tedder, and signed by Artist Driven Records and Republic Records, she instigates a fascinating conversation with her new single \u201cI\u2019m not Pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want all of my songs to feel like you\u2019re sitting down and having a cup of tea with me,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s very minimalistic. To me, less is more, and it\u2019s really about the lyrics. I\u2019m talking about my life and my friends\u2019 stories. I\u2019ll be on the phone with somebody and literally stop like, \u2018Hold up. I need to write a song about this!\u2019 That\u2019s how it happens.\u201d\n\nVancouver-based JESSIA, started singing before she could talk and by the age of two, had already charmed a crowd at the local legion. With mom as a music teacher, she learned to play the guitar early on and started writing songs at the age of eleven.\u202f Graduating high school early to pursue her dream, she attended University, majoring in vocal performance and broke into the business by penning and performing toplines for electronic artists, most notably on Burgess\u2019 hit \u201cEclipse.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2019, everything came crashing down. \u201cI hit rock bottom and lost my creative direction and was second guessing myself pursuing music and just becoming a travel agent instead to have a more stable job.\u201d\u202f\u202f\n\nAs she walked home one night, something changed.\u202f \u201cI stopped in a park and wrote \u201cTell Me\u201d singing little voice notes into my phone.\u201d That opened the floodgates and she began writing up to three songs per day.\u202f Inspired by the likes of Julia Michaels and Hayley Williams, she held nothing back.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I only saw myself as a singer,\u201d she continues. \u201cAfter I was stripped of who I was, I realized I am a songwriter, and I might actually have something to say. So, I started to explore myself as a multidimensional artist.\u201d\n\nAt the top of 2020, she made a pilgrimage to Indonesia and learned what it was like to live life with no restrictions. \u201cI felt like I was living my own version of Eat Pray Love.\u201d\u202f She returned home inspired and refreshed, realizing she was ready to launch her career as an independent artist.\u202f A month later, she released her debut single \u201cTell Me.\u201d Locking into a prolific groove, she dropped \u201cConviction\u201d and \u201cReally Nice To Think About\u201d and gained early support from Spotify, gracing coveted playlists such as New Music Friday, It\u2019s A Bop and Amazon\u2019s Ones To Watch 2020.\u202f\u202f\n\nOn January 1, 2021, everything changed. Sitting in her car, she introduced an acapella hook for what would become \u201cI\u2019m not Pretty\u201d on TikTok, by admitting, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is total trash, or if it\u2019s actually a bop.\u201d\n\nTurns out, it was the latter\u2026\u202f\n\nThe candid lyrics describe a journey towards self-love and the emotions one can feel while on its path. The song\u2019s message resonated with so many and generated 1 million views in a day. Meanwhile, 4x JUNO Award nominee, singer, songwriter, and producer elijah woods took notice of the initial clip, reached out, and together they finished the song in 48 hours in front of millions by sharing a series of TikTok posts. Produced by woods, the official release hinges on raw acoustic guitar as she sings, \u201cEvery other song says I\u2019m beautiful, but what if I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m beautiful. I wish my body image didn\u2019t say that I should be another kindaway.\u201d It eventually hit\u202f 25 million streams in the first month.\n\n\u201cThis is about self-love and body acceptance for everyone\u2013 all of humanity. I\u2019m singing about eating disorders and personal insecurities. If you\u2019re struggling, definitely ask for help. I want this song to be a tool for people to realize how amazing they are, and how liberating it is to accept yourself.\u202f This song is not meant to seek validation from other people\u2019s opinions. It is about your own relationship with yourself and your own body. It\u2019s an important relationship that is not talked about enough. Be proud of who you are and know sometimes it\u2019s a long journey to get there. Smile at yourself in the mirror, jiggle your belly, and be okay with being a human,\u201d she encourages.\n\nAs \u201cI\u2019m not Pretty\u201d took flight, Ryan Tedder sent a DM and signed JESSIA to Artist Driven Records in partnership with Republic Records, igniting what she calls \u201cA dream come true.\u201d\u202f\n\nNow, she\u2019s ready more than ever to have a conversation.\n\n\u201cWhen you listen to me, I want you to feel like you\u2019re powerful, you\u2019ve been given the tools to love yourself, and feel like you\u2019re not alone,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI write my songs to get me through the day and it\u2019s like my own personal therapy session. If it helps other people, that is just the cherry on top. I want my songs to talk about the rough stuff and be real. We aren\u2019t perfect and I\u2019m sick of trying to act as though we are. I know my story seems surreal and like a dream, and it kinda is, but to all of those struggling and frustrated artists out there, yeah, it is actually possible.\u201d"
