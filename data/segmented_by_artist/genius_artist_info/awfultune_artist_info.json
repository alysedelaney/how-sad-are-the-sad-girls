      "plain": "Meet awfultune, aka 22-year-old Layla Eden. Raconteur, songwriter, storyteller and vocalist who since 2018 has been producing and releasing music independently from a laptop in upstate New York, and now sits on top of over 80 million global streams \u2013 officially evolving out of indie bedroom-pop obscurity.\n\nThe \u2018Dear Sarah\u2019 EP (out Dec 2) is more rooted in emotional truth than reality, exploring the narrative in depth over the course of 2 songs and 2 interludes. Sarah represents Layla\u2019s bolder, uninhibited alter ego; more than anything, it is a love letter to herself. Strewn together masterfully on the garage band app in just about an hour, \u201cI Met Sarah In The Bathroom\u201d is a truly stand-out addition to Eden\u2019s collection of wistful, Lo-fi storytelling compositions that continue to capture the imaginations of millions of listeners all over the globe.\n\nIts unapologetic narrative has all the qualities of an indie movie in the making. Eden\u2019s never been hesitant to bare her soul on the lyrical page, but there\u2019s an unfettered verve in Sarah\u2019s character arc that can be traced to a watershed moment in Eden\u2019s own life: a gender re-identification, and the subsequent peace Eden found with it.\n\nHer journey is being openly documented through Instagram to share with her fans who show unfettering support which in turn \u2013 she offers to them. Production of a mini-documentary following her journey is in progress for release in the new year. She is both an austere champion of the LGBTQ+ community and a perennial advocate for anyone who\u2019s simply ever felt alone or estranged from themselves."
