      "plain": "Hana Vu writes pop songs from her bedroom in Los Angeles. She signed to Ghostly International in 2021, releasing \u201cMaker,\u201d the first glimpse of new material to come.\n\nVu\u2019s relationship with music began when she picked up a guitar her dad had lying around and taught herself to play. She\u2019d wake up every day and listen to LA\u2019s ALT 98.7, home to \u201890s and '00s alternative rock; later in high school, she found the local DIY scene. She remembers, \u201cA lot of my peer musicians were surf rock/punk type bands and so I tried to fit into that when I was gigging around. But what I was listening to at that time (St. Vincent, Sufjan Stevens) was very different from what I performed.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, at age 14, she started keeping a journal of bedroom pop experiments on Bandcamp. Her sound \u2014 brooding, melodic pop driven by guitar and Vu\u2019s distinctive contralto \u2014 developed across a series of self-releases, including a low-key WILLOW collaboration and covers of The Cure and Phil Collins. Her 2018 single \u201cCrying on the Subway\u201d caught the ear of Gorilla vs. Bear, who released Vu\u2019s self-produced debut EP, How Many Times Have You Driven By, on their Luminelle Recordings imprint. Early coverage came from Pitchfork, NME, and The Fader, the latter playfully declaring, \u201cthe seventeen-year-old is cooler than you and me.\u201d She followed it up with a double EP in 2019 on Luminelle titled Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway.\n\nAs a live performer, Vu has supported the likes of Soccer Mommy, SALES, Nil\u00fcfer Yanya, Wet, Kilo Kish, and Phantogram. The 2021 single, \u201cMaker,\u201d marks her first release with Ghostly and her first time working with a co-producer, Jackson Phillips (Day Wave)."
