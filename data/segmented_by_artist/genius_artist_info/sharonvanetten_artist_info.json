      "plain": "Sharon Van Etten (born February 26, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter. Her folk-influenced music is notable for its heavy use of harmonies, which she credits to her experience as part of a choir group. Growing up in New Jersey, Sharon began songwriting as a high school student, and also studied the clarinet, violin, piano, and guitar. NPR Music described her work, saying:\n\nHer songs are heartfelt without being overly earnest; her poetry is plainspoken but not overt, and her elegant voice is wrapped in enough rasp and sorrow to keep from sounding too pure or confident.\n\nPrior to the release of her 2009 debut album, Because I Was in Love, Sharon worked as a music publicist at Brooklyn-based Ba Da Bing Records, and self-released handmade CDs. However, it is Sharon\u2019s second release, Epic, that is often considered to be her breakout album \u2013 the closing track (\u201cLove More\u201d) has been covered live by artists such as Bon Iver, and The National."
