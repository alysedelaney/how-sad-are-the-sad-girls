      "plain": "Brittney Denise Parks, better known by her stage name Sudan Archives, is an American violinist and singer-songwriter from Cincinnati, Ohio. She is based in Los Angeles, CA and is currently signed to Stones Throw Records.\n\nHer music marries Sudanese folk music, as well as other soulful African elements with R&B and experimental electronic. Much of her music is self-written and produced with no extra assistance.\n\nSudan was a nickname her mum gave her when she was 16, whilst Archives\u2014in reference to musicologist archives\u2014embodies what she calls the  \u201cdigging deeper\u201d into one\u2019s self.\n\nShe began playing the violin at the tender age of four. Whilst an expressive character in high school, Sudan didn\u2019t have many friends and instead found solace in the choir of the Pentecostal church her father pastored\u2014and in exploring musical traditions from other cultures online, which would come to shape her own eclectic style.\n\nShe released her self titled EP in June of 2017.  It was soon followed by Sink EP in 2018. In 2019 she released her first album\u2014Athena."
