      "plain": "Having this identity\u2014radical indigenous queer feminist\u2014keeps me going. My music and my identity come from the same foundation of being a Native woman. \u2014 Katherine Paul\n\nKatherine Paul (aka KP) is Black Belt Eagle Scout, and after releasing an EP in 2014 Paul has wrapped up her first full-length, Mother of My Children.\n\nPaul was born in Anacortes, Washington and grew up in a small Indian reservation, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, surrounded by family focused on native drumming, singing, and arts. \u201cIndigenous music is the foundation for all of my music,\u201d Paul explains. From an early age, Paul was singing and dancing at powwows with one of her strongest memories at her family\u2019s own powwow, called the All My Relations Powwow. Paul reminisces, \u201cWhen I was younger, my only form of music was through the songs my ancestors taught the generations of my family. Singing in our language is a spiritual process and it carries on through me in how I create music today.\u201d\n\nWith the support of her family and a handful of bootleg Hole and Nirvana VHS tapes, Paul taught herself how to play guitar and drums as a teenager. In 2007, Paul moved to Portland, OR, to attend college and get involved with the Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Camp for Girls. Inspired by Riot Grrrl and Post-Rock bands like Sleater-Kinney and Do Make Say Think, Paul dove deep into the Portland music scene, playing guitar and drums in Forest Park and drums in Genders while evolving her artistry into what would later be Black Belt Eagle Scout."
