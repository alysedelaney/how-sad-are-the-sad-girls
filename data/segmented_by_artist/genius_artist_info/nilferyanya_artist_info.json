      "plain": "Nil\u00fcfer Yanya (b. May 11, 1995) is an English singer-songwriter from Chelsea, London. She describes her music as \u201craw \u2013 even when it\u2019s a finished track it\u2019s still got that kind of unfinished, unpolished edge to it\u201d and it combines influences of soul, indie rock, jazz, and trip-hop.\n\nAfter putting out a series of three short EPs from 2016 to 2018, Yanya released her debut full-length album Miss Universe in 2019 to rave reviews and critical acclaim. Pitchfork said that the LP \u201ctakes adventurous pop-rock crucibles to new heights with her illusory songwriting and stunning voice.\u201d"
