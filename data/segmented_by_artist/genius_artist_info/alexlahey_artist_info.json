      "plain": "Alex Lahey hocked her beloved 1999 blue Corolla to pay for the recording of her debut EP. First single out of the boot was last year\u2019s Air Mail, introducing the airwaves to the Melbourne-based singer-songwriter\u2019s knack for melodic, guitar-driven hooks.\n\nMost recently Lahey has set the music industry abuzz with the insanely catchy You Don\u2019t Think You Like People Like Me. From the attention-grabbing opening bars (those drums sound like an angry landlord thumping your front door on a Sunday morning), it flips the classic break-up line \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d on its head. Upon release in March, People\u2026 was immediately added to rotation on triple j, triple j unearthed, Syn FM and FBi FM, and started popping up on music blogs everywhere. It was then Pitchfork gave it Best New Track and got the rest of the world talking.\n\nA founding member of avant poppers Animaux, multi-instrumentalist Lahey has now gone solo and pared down her sound, embracing a simple, home-spun story-telling style that\u2019s often underlined by her second love, the fuzz pedal.\n\nAlong with her new three-piece band and producer Oscar Dawson (Holy Holy, Ali Barter), Lahey released her debut EP\nB-Grade University in July 29, 2016 \u2013 bound to be the year\u2019s greatest Corolla-funded release."
