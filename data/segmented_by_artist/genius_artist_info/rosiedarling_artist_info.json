      "plain": "Like many artists, electro songstress Rosie Darling grew up in a creative and bustling household. Around the age of twelve, her dad taught her a few chords on the guitar, and those lessons, coupled with the rise of mega singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, propelled Rosie into her own storytelling. At fourteen, she got into the studio and found that the recording process came naturally to her. In her words, the studio is her safe place. After casually writing and performing throughout the rest of high school and college, Rosie decided to pursue music more seriously, toplining on some tracks and connecting with producers. In 2017, Rosie and producer OKO released \u201cL.A.,\u201d and with millions of streams on Spotify, the track has done well considering the pair released it entirely on their own. Later, Rosie wrote \u201cNever Be The Same\u201d for EDM duo Tritonal, and the track hit number one on SiriusXM\u2019s BPM radio. After moving to Los Angeles from the East Coast, Rosie took on the daunting task of networking in a city that is notoriously spread out and filled to the brim with other artists on the rise. After only two years in LA, Rosie has built a strong network of producers and songwriters, crediting her success to her focus and determination, along with a bit of risk-taking. But fully pursuing a passion can come with a price, and Rosie has poured all the loss and love of the past couple of years into her first artist statement Coping, her debut EP on Nettwerk Records."
