      "plain": "Quinnie is a New Jersey based bedroom pop artist who makes \u201cbedroom pop 4 the too sentimental soul\u201d.\n\nHer music often has a dreamy, effortless feel to it. This can be heard through the lyrics and instrumentals, as well as seen through album covers which seem to have a scrap book quality to them."
