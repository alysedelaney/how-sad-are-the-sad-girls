      "plain": "Isolation is nothing new for Fenne Lily \u2013 in fact, she\u2019s written an album of songs all about it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like writing a letter, and leaving it in a book that you know you\u2019ll get out when you\u2019re sad \u2013 like a message to yourself in the future,\u201d she says, referring to BREACH, her Dead Oceans debut she wrote during a period of self-enforced isolation pre-COVID. It\u2019s an expansive, diaristic, frequently sardonic record that deals with the mess and the catharsis of entering your 20s and finding peace while being alone. \u201cI think this record is proof that I can be emotionally stable, even if right now I feel a little bit up and down,\u201d says Fenne. \u201cThere\u2019s the ability to find clarity in that. It\u2019s sobering, weirdly.\u201d\n\nFenne was born in London and moved to Dorset as a toddler, where she grew up in the picturesque English countryside. She was a \u201cfree range kid,\u201d as she calls it, after her parents took her out of school for a period at the age of seven. Over the following year, they taught her while the family travelled Europe in a live-in bus. Even after she returned to traditional school at 9, her home education never ended, extending to music. Her mother gifted Fenne with her old record collection, through which she discovered her love for T-Rex and the Velvet Underground and Nico. Soon after she fell for the strange genius of PJ Harvey and came to worship Nick Drake, Joni Mitchell, and the richly crafted worlds of Feist, which inspired Fenne to pick up a guitar.\n\nOn Hold, a tender collection of expressive, open-hearted songs, was Fenne\u2019s first foray into songwriting, written during her teenage years. Writing her own songs was initially a \u201ctherapy exercise\u201d for Fenne, who is normally reserved when it comes to talking about her feelings. The album, self-released in 2018, organically found a large audience online, which grew after she opened for Lucy Dacus and Andy Shauf\u2019s North American tours last spring. Surrounding its release, The Line of Best Fit deemed Fenne \u201ca new and extraordinary voice capable of wringing profound and resonant moments out of loss.\u201d\n\nWhere On Hold grappled with love and relationships, BREACH digs deeper into Fenne herself. \u201cI tried to write about my inner life, as opposed to how people affect my life as a third party,\u201d she explains. Written after a disjointed experience of touring Europe, and then spending a month alone in Berlin, the album deals largely with \u201cfeeling lonely. And trying to work out the difference between being alone and being lonely.\u201d Although its subject matter is solitude, it sounds bigger and more intricate than anything Fenne previously released. Acclaimed producer Brian Deck, who she recorded with at Chicago\u2019s Narwhal Studios, and Steve Albini (Electrical Audio) helped flesh out her sound with vast, rich guitars.\n\nLead single \u2018Alapathy\u2019 is the first taste of a newly upbeat and urgent streak to Fenne\u2019s songwriting. Its insistent percussion mimics the anxious racing thoughts that Fenne deals with as an overthinker and chronicles how she \u201cstarted smoking weed to switch off [her] brain.\u201d The title is a made-up word that merges \u2018apathy\u2019 and \u2018allopathic\u2019 (as in Westernized medicine). \u201cWestern medicine generally treats the symptoms of an illness rather than the cause,\u201d explains Fenne. For Fenne, taking medication to improve her mental health didn\u2019t solve her problems because she felt like she was only treating the effects of her discomfort, not the reason for it.\n\nElsewhere, there are brighter songs on the album. Fenne wrote hazed-out lo-fi rock song \u2018Solipsism\u2019 after watching a documentary about the Stone Roses. She wanted to create \u201csomething that sounded cheerful, about something really not cheerful.\u201d The song deals with the anxieties of a social media driven generation, \u201cbecause everyone is sharing everything, and everyone\u2019s comparing their lives to other people\u2019s.\u201c She sighs her age (\"twentyyyyy\u2026 ohhh\u201d) over the strident surge of guitar fuzz, as she sings about the pressure to have more fun in her 20s, and the solipsism that keeps her awake.\n\nOn slowly unfurling \u2018Berlin\u2019, which she describes as her defining moment of the record, Fenne has a hushed-yet-powerful energy. It was written during her time alone in Berlin after her third reading of Patti Smith\u2019s Just Kids, and made a solo voyage to the popular nightclub Berghain. The experience was one of pushing her own boundaries, and the morning after, she woke up and wrote \u2018Berlin\u2019, a careful, beautiful declaration celebrating being comfortable being alone.\n\nThe songs that make up BREACH layer Fenne\u2019s own experiences with what she\u2019s learned from others. Initially, \u2018Elliott\u2019 was inspired by someone she met in Bristol who turned his back on the allure of being in a rock band to run a hardware shop. As the lyrics started to arrive, the song \u201cbecame clearly about my dad\u2019s childhood and solidified the record as something chronicling more than my own stories,\u201d says Fenne. \u2018Elliott\u2019, with its gentle harmonies, is a peaceful moment that condenses many of the record\u2019s themes: family, the relationship between our child and adult selves, and the decision to follow an isolated, untrodden path.\n\nIt\u2019s that journey to find peace inside herself that underpins the whole of Fenne\u2019s second album. Its title, BREACH, occurred to Fenne after deep conversations with her mum about her birth, during which she was breech, or upside down in the womb. The slippery double-sidedness of the word \u2013 which, spelled with an \u2018A\u2019, means to \u201cbreak through\u201d \u2013 drew her in. \u201cThat feels like what I was doing in this record; I was breaking through a wall that I built for myself, keeping myself safe, and dealing with the downside of feeling lonely and alone. I realized that I am comfortable in myself, and I don\u2019t need to fixate on relationships to make myself feel like I have something to talk about. I felt like I broke through a mental barrier in that respect.\u201d Even though it also carries implications of awkwardness, rebellion, and breakage, it\u2019s a wide-reaching word, representing new beginnings and birth."
