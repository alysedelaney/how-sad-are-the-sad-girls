      "plain": "Margaret Debay Rogers (born April 25, 1994), better known as Maggie Rogers, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and producer from Easton, Maryland.\n\nHer first hit song \u201cAlaska\u201d went viral when Pharrell reviewed it. Rogers says in the song review video  that \u201cAlaska\u201d is the combination of her folk music background and a more recent love of dance music. She defines her genre as movement/feelings.\n\nAll I want to do is combine the folk imagery and harmony and natural samples that I\u2019ve been picking up while hiking over the last couple of years, with the backbone and energy of dance music\u2026"
