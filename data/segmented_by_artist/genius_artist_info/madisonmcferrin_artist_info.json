      "plain": "The Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter/producer Madison McFerrin crafts rich, infectious soul songs using only her voice. With an array of loops and percussive backing vocals, she creates a textured sound with room for her emotional explorations: Her debut EP, Finding Foundations: Vol. I, explored heartache, self-care, and budding romances. McFerrin\u2019s new single, \u201cInsane\u201d (off her follow up EP, Finding Foundations: Vol. II), continues her a cappella experiments, this time to convey pure joy through cascading harmonies and a bubbling, jazzy arrangement.\n\nMcFerrin is the daughter of vocal luminary Bobby McFerrin, and the sister of two talented siblings, the electronic artist Taylor McFerrin and the Broadway actor Jevon McFerrin."
