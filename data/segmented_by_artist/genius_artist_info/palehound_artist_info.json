      "plain": "Palehound is the latest project from Yonkers, NY based singer/songwriter extraordinaire Ellen Kempner. Writing and performing her own songs since she was 10 years old, Kempner has played in bands (Cheerleader) and solo (Kempa), developing an amazing knack for songwriting in the process. Kempa\u2019s self-recorded Dog on Crutches was released early 2012, a stunning collection of smart lo-fi indie rock that sticks in your head. Late during her freshman year of college, Kempner decided to create a revolving band, and Palehound was born. Wasting no time, Kempner began recording Palehound\u2019s debut at Brooklyn\u2019s Gravesend Recordings with Ava Luna\u2019s Julian Fader and Carlos Hernandez. The results are simply stunning. Palehound\u2019s Bent Nail EP is due out on October 22nd through Exploding In Sound Records on limited edition cassette and digital. When asked about the record, Kempner shared, \u201cthis collection of songs definitely exhibits my uncomfortable shift from teenage-hood to \u201cadulthood\u201d and the fact that regardless of what I felt like I should be as an adult, I still felt the same as I did when I was fifteen.\u201d"
