She is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, and the younger sister of Jaden Smith, who also performs mononymously as Jaden, and Trey Smith.\n\nSmith launched her aspiring music career in the autumn of 2010 with the release of the singles \u201cWhip My Hair\u201d and \u201c21st Century Girl\u201d after signing to her mentor Jay-Z\u2019s record label Roc Nation, becoming the youngest artist signed to the label. \u201cWhip My Hair\u201d peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video was nominated for Video of the Year at the BET Awards of 2011 and garnered over 200 million views.\n\nAside from being a solo artist, Willow is in an electronic-pop-punk duo with her best friend Tyler Cole that started in February 28, 2020, called \u201cTHE ANXIETY\u201d.\n\nShe is signed to her brother Jaden\u2019s record label, MSFTS Music.

The show premise is to show perspectives of three different generations on a wide variety of topics. It won an NAACP Image award for Outstanding Host in a Talk or News.\n\nWILLOW returned in 2021 with her smash single \u201ct r a n s p a r e n t s o u l\u201d featuring legendary Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, and it beckoned a new era in her music, and later announced that her new album was on the way, and it was largely inspired by her mother\u2019s own nu-metal band, Wicked Wisdom."
