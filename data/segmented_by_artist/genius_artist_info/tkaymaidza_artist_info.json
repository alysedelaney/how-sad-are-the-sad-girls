      "plain": "Tkay Maidza (real name Takudzwa Victoria Rosa Maidza) is an Adelaide-based rapper/singer known for her high-energy tracks and uncompromising take on Australian hip-hop. Born in Zimbabwe, hers is a talent and voice bucking the mainstream popularity of \u2018skip-hop\u2019.\n\nI remember when I first started, I used to see things on Aussie hip-hop forums\u2026[People] being like, \u2018Hey guys, do we like this?\u2019 And then the guys would be like, \u2018Um nah, it\u2019s too pop for me,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s too weird,\u2019 or, \u2018This isn\u2019t real.\u2019 And in the beginning I was just really sad, but then I started to realise that what I was doing was not for them and it didn\u2019t bother me\u2026I began to understand that I didn\u2019t really want to fit in, and I didn\u2019t mind.\n\nDebut single \u201cBrontosaurus\u201d was released when she was only seventeen years old and received strong support from national radio station Triple J. She cites Santigold and Nicki Minaj as inspirations. Her admirers include Killer Mike who gave her a shout-out and guest verse on single \u201cCarry On\u201d.\n\nHer debut album TKAY released on October 28, 2016. Followed up by 2 EP\u2019s Last Year Was Weird, Vol.1 in 2018 and her latest EP Last Year Was Weird, Vol.2 in 2020."
