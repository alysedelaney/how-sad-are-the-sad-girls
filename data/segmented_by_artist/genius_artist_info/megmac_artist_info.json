      "plain": "Australian neo-soul singer Megan McInerney, who performs under the name Meg Mac, began her career in 2013 when she uploaded a pair of independent singles to her Triple J Unearthed account. The second of those tracks, \u201cEvery Lie,\u201d was put into heavy rotation on Triple J and helped her win the station\u2019s Unearthed Competition to play a set at the prestigious Falls Festival on New Year\u2019s Eve of that year. Inspired by artists like Adele and Amy Winehouse and classic soul acts like Sam Cooke and Ray Charles, her star rose throughout 2014 as she continued releasing singles, toured, and prepared her debut EP, MEGMAC, which was released in June 2015. The EP enjoyed plenty of chart success in Australia, earning Mac an ARIA Music Award nomination and yielding the hit single \u201cNever Be.\u201d Her full-length debut, Low Blows, arrived in the summer of 2017 and was preceded by a single of the same name. The single \u201cGive Me My Name Back\u201d arrived in 2018 and would eventually land on her 2019 release Hope.\"\n\nTimothy Monger for AllMusic"
