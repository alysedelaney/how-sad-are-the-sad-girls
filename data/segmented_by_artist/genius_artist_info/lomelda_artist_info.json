      "plain": "Hannah Read, better known by her stage name Lomelda, is a Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter hailing from Silsbee, Texas. Lomelda is a made up word that, according to Read, means \u201cecho of the stars\u201d.\n\nRead began playing guitar at a young age, following the footsteps of her older brother Tommy. She played in bands with him and with high school friends, before starting her own project Lomelda in 2008, gathering a group of friends (including long time drummer Zach Daniel) to perform with her.\n\nIn 2012, Lomelda self-released her debut project, Late Dawn Inheritance. Her proper debut album, Forever, came out three years later."
