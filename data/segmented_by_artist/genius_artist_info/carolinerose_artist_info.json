      "plain": "Characterized by a deadpan wit, playful and sarcastic tone, and eccentric personality, Caroline Rose is a talented New York-based singer, songwriter, and producer. Rose got her start in the industry, surprisingly, by hosting a GoFundMe to fund her debut: 2012\u2019s America Religious, for which they managed to raise $10,000 of their $7,000 goal. After releasing her second album and first official release, I Will Not Be Afraid, Rose went on an extended hiatus. She returned in 2018 with a new record and an accompanying new sound. Compared to the Americana/folk of her previous two releases, Loner featured much more indie- and pop-influenced production, instrumentation, and even songwriting. In spite of this sharp pivot, Rose\u2019s playful personality effectively shone through on their return record, and because of this, it was recieved largely positively, with even Pitchfork awarding it a 7.6 and several members of the Genius Community naming it on their top albums of that year.\nCaroline built on the momentum from their return record with 2020\u2019s Superstar, a more conceptual and stripped-back album with similar Indie and Pop roots as Loner. She has described it as a concept album about someone who wants to become famous, and features expressive vocals ranging from carefree on tracks such as \u201cFeel the way I want\u201d to almost na\u00efve and needy on \u201cDo You Think We\u2019ll Last Forever?\u201d Superstar was awarded an 81 on metacritic and is a shining example of Caroline\u2019s talent and diversity as a songwriter, dabbling in more disco- and funk-influenced tracks than their previous release, and demonstrating their diverse range.\nIn 2022, Rose released another single, Love/Lover/Friend teasing toward a new album. Sonically, this new album appears to feature yet another pivot to a more orchestrated, ambient style of music, possibly pointing toward a similar style for the upcoming record."
