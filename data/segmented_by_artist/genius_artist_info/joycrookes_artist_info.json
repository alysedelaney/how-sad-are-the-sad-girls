      "plain": "Joy Elizabeth Akther Crookes (born October 9th, 1998), known professionally as simply Joy Crookes, is a singer-songwriter hailing from South London, England. Born to a Bangladeshi mother and an Irish father, Crookes\u2019s multinational background is one of the most important parts of her artistry.\n\nBy only the age of thirteen, Crookes had gained a strong interest in music, quickly teaching herself how to play the guitar, piano, and bass. Soon after, she began to write her own music. In a matter of only two years, Crookes had gained recognition from several thousand people, including her current manager, thanks to her cover of \u201cHit The Road Jack\u201d by Ray Charles that she posted to her YouTube channel.\n\nHer debut single \u201cNew Manhattan\u201d was released in February, 2016, quickly followed by her next single \u201cSinatra\u201d in August, 2016. She released one more single, \u201cBad Feeling,\u201d in June, 2017, before releasing her debut EP, Influence, which featured two additional songs. The two non-single songs, \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cMother May I Sleep With Danger\u201d catapulted Crookes into the music industry, mainly thanks to her performance on A COLORS Show, which has garnered over 8 million views.\n\nCrookes dropped two more EP\u2019s in 2019, Reminiscence and Perception, and released her debut album Skin in 2021.  Besides music, Crookes takes pride as a prominent activist against xenophobia, gentrification, and racism\u2014 she always tries to represent her heritage in every way possible.\n\nHer vocal style and unique songwriting abilities have brought forth the comparisons to Amy Winehouse and Lauryn Hill."
