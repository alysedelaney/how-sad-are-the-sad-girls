      "plain": "Gretta Ray is an indie-pop artist from Melbourne, Australia. She made a precocious entrance to the Australian music scene with the release of her debut EP \u2018Elsewhere\u2019 on the 10th of February, 2016. However, she gained her first serious exposure when her single \u2018Drive\u2019, released later that year, won the Triple J Unearthed High competition as well as the Vanda & Young songwriting competition.\n\n\n\nJust as impressively, the song came in at #27 on Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 of 2016, clearly a local hit.\n\nShe has also toured with her good friend Japanese Wallpaper as a member of his live band."
