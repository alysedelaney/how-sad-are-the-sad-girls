      "plain": "Sarah Beth Tomberlin is an American singer-songwriter.\n\nBorn in Jacksonville, Florida, and now based in Louisville, Kentucky, Tomberlin is the daughter of a Baptist pastor and grew up in southern Illinois. Her first music experience was singing in church.\n\nAt 16, she finished her homeschooling curriculum and went to college at a private Christian school she describes, only half-jokingly, as a \u201ccult.\u201d By 17, she had dropped out of school, returned home, and begun to face a period of difficult transition in her life. She found herself questioning not only her faith, but her identity, her purpose, and her place in the world.\n\nWhen she was 19, she wrote \u201cTornado\u201d on her parents' piano, and began to develop confidence in her music. A year later, she had written enough songs to fill an album."
