      "plain": "Citing influences ranging from Mountain Man to Billy Bragg to Gillian Welch, Australian singer-songwriter Julia Jacklin seamlessly blends dream pop and soft rock flavors into a unique and gently minimalist sound. That sound acts as a canvas for her candid lyricism, lending her music a distinctly intimate and unconcealed vibe.\n\nJacklin released her debut album Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win in October 2016 at the age of 26, with singles \u201cPool Party\u201d and \u201cComing of Age\u201d earning her some quiet buzz as an up-and-coming artist. She followed that release in early 2019 with Crushing.\n\nOn top of her solo career, Jacklin channels a more playful, rock-oriented vibe with her band Phantastic Ferniture. The group released their self-titled debut in 2018."
