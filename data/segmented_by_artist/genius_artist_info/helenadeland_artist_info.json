      "plain": "Helena Deland writes melodic pop songs with an extraordinary understanding of space and sound. The Montreal songwriter writes music that feels very human: it\u2019s at once evocative yet hazy, self-assured yet fallible. Her lyrics conjure images and feelings that seem to promptly slip out of grasp, as if she\u2019s piecing together fragments of memories to unearth something deeper."
