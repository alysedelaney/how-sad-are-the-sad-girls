      "plain": "Eleanor Friedberger is an indie-pop singer-songwriter who first gained attention in the early 2000s as one-half of the duo The Fiery Furnaces. The duo\u2019s work earned polarized reviews from music critics, and took a hiatus in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Friedberger released her debut solo album, Last Summer. The album was warmly received by music critics, as were her next three records: 2013\u2019s Personal Record, 2016\u2019s New View, and 2018\u2019s Rebound. Friedber\u2019s warm vocals have frequently earned comparisons to Carly Simon.\n\nWhile a member of the FFs, Friedberger was the subject of a Franz Ferdinand song, \u201cEleanor Put Your Boots On,\u201d written after she dated the group\u2019s front man."
