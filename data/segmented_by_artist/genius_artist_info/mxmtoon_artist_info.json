      "plain": "mxmtoon (pronounced em-ex-em-toon) is the moniker of Maia (born July 9, 2000), an Oakland-based singer, songwriter, and ukulele player. mxmtoon has a considerable online following, amounting to the hundreds of thousands, and successfully links conceptually relatable songs with goofy, self-deprecating music videos, of which evoke emotions across the gamut\u2014everything from belly-laughing to weeping. She carries a persona that can be described as passionate, genuine, and warm; a friend who can be relied on through even the most emotionally challenging of times.\n\nmxmtoon covers a wide range of conceptual themes in her music; such themes include matters regarding friendship, romance, body confidence, identity and teenage insecurities. She often uses a ukulele for accompaniment and has a distinctly unique musical sound characterized by elements of indie and bedroom pop, as well as slightly laconic lyrical delivery and sometimes unconventional melodic constructs. This style shined all throughout her debut EP plum blossom, which was recorded from the confines of her parents' guest room, and was released on December 7, 2018.\n\nNine months later, the Cavetown produced effort that was her debut full-length album the masquerade was released in September 17, 2019, followed by dawn and dusk in April 22, 2020 and October 1, 2020 respectively, with the latter two later being integrated into dawn & dusk, which was released on November 5, 2020."
