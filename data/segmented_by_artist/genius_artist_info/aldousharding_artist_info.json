      "plain": "Aldous (Hannah) Harding (born 1990) is a self-described \u201cgothic folk\u201d singer-songwriter from Lyttelton, New Zealand.\n\nShe debuted in 2014 with her eponymous album. Described by The New York Times as \u201cgoth-folk\u201d, Aldous Harding draws themes of misfortune and death with an \u201ceerie, archaic English folk flavor\u201d.\n\nMore recently, Harding teamed up with PJ Harvey collaborator, producer John Parish, for her second album Party, released in 2017, Harding\u2019s outstanding effort on songs about love and strength, with an undeniable goth-folk twist."
