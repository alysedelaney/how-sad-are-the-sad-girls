      "plain": "Kelsey Byrne, or well-known as V\u00c9RIT\u00c9 was born in 1990, in New York. She is an American singer-songwriter.  In July 2014, she self-released her debut single \u201cStrange Enough\u201d and her debut EP, Echo EP, in October 2014. In an interview with SPIN, she said that she never worried about what genre her music actually is.\n\nWhen it comes to production and the overall sound I don\u2019t really have a lot of intentions with it. I start off with melody and a lyrical idea, and then build off of that story. All the lyrics were written from stream of consciousness, and then I tried to string together these little bits of inspiration into a cohesive idea.\u200b"
