      "plain": "Bully is an alternative/punk rock band originally from Nashville, TN. Frontwoman Alicia Bognanno, a Minnesota native, started out on the more technical side of music as an engineer. After moving to Nashville, she recruited the other members of Bully and formed the band.\n\nThe music of Bully is punctuated by Alicia\u2019s trademark yells and screams, which help to convey the cathartic elements of her lyrics about getting through painful emotional situations. This sentiment is reflected by the title of the band\u2019s aptly-named debut LP, Feels Like."
