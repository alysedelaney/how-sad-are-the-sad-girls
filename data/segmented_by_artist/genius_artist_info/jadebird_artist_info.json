      "plain": "Listening to the country-folk acoustic tone and stripped-down soul of Jade Bird\u2019s voice, you\u2019d expect her natural raw talent to be inherited, but her musical background is anything but.\n\nBorn into a military family, she had a wild childhood, constantly moving around to different military bases \u2013 but nothing as wild as her \u201cproper rave head\u201d parents\u2019s love for EDM. So how did the British singer-songwriter find country and the blues? The influence of strong working women.\n\nAfter the divorce of her parents, she settled in South Wales with her mother and grandmother, who were the foundation of empowerment in her early life. Then as she grew up, her female role models expanded to the artists in the music subcultures she was obsessed with: Loretta Lynn and Patti Smith. Influenced by her two pillars of music inspiration, Jade took her own path at the tender age of 12 \u2013 learning guitar and transforming her own experiences into art through songwriting.\n\nAlong the way she found her sound, putting her spin on modern Americana, weaved with the blues, country, and folk \u2013\u00a0and moved to London at the age of 16 to pursue a music career.\n\nIn 2017 she released her debut EP, Something American, a bittersweet tale of the reality of a modern British teenager. The EP did not go unnoticed, with Rolling Stone naming her as a \u201cnew country artist you need to know.\u201d To conclude the year, she was a nominee of the BBC \u201cSound of\u2026\u201d poll, voted by British music critics and industry experts to find the most promising upcoming talent."
