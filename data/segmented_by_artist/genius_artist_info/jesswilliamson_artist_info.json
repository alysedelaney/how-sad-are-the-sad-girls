      "plain": "Born in Texas, the USA, jess Williamson got into music in her college years where after photographing school bands for a number of years, she picked up the banjo and began composing home recordings. In 2018 she released her first album, Cosmic Wink, inspired by her recent move to Los Angeles. Her music has since then grown from her country roots  into something exquisite, powerful, vulnerable and unique."
