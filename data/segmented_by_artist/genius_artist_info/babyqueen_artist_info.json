      "plain": "Baby Queen, real name Bella, is a new, upcoming indie-pop alternative artist, based in London, England. She made her debut with the single \u201cInternet Religion\u201d which was featured in the Spotify playlist  \u201cNew Music Friday\u201d and \u201cHot New Bands\u201d.\n\nOn her Spotify and youtube page she wrote:\n\u201cReasons to be friends with Baby Queen:\nShe knows lots of facts about Taylor Swift and is willing to share them with you\nShe uses big and cool words like krukolibidinous which may act to startle and confuse your enemies\nYou are most likely never to find yourself in conversation with her about a) star signs or b) spiritual energies; and she has never checked her daily horoscope\n\nReasons to run away from Baby Queen if she approaches you in public:\nShe believes we are being lied to by secret operations within the American Government about the aliens, which could lead to several uncomfortable disagreements in social situations\nShe broke into somebody\u2019s house by smashing a red hammer through their bathroom window which is quite awkward and not at all awesome. It\u2019s a big red flag to be honest.\nAccording to God, she is \u201cthe most annoying person in the world,\u201d but that is obviously just one man\u2019s opinion and he doesn\u2019t know her personally.\""
