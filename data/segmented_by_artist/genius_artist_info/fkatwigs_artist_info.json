      "plain": "Tahliah Barnett (born 16 January, 1988), known by the stage name FKA twigs (\u201cFKA\u201d is reported, but has been denied, to mean \u201cFormerly Known As\u201d) is a British dancer, director, composer, singer, and producer.\n\nShe got her start in music with ballet and singing on tracks recorded in a Jamaican Club. Her electronically tinged, haunting music is reminiscent of  the work of Bj\u00f6rk, Portishead, The xx, Tricky, and Massive Attack.\n\nBefore she had a career in music, she was an extremely sought-after pop-video dancer in London. She has appeared in videos by Taio Cruz, Jessie J, Ed Sheeran, Kylie Minogue and others.\n\nHer first extended play, EP1, was self-released on Bandcamp in 2012 under the stage name \u201ctwigs,\u201d referring to the way her joints crack as she dances. EP2 was released the following year under her current stage name after she was forced to change it after the band The Twigs were upset with the similarity of her name to theirs.\n\nFKA twigs then worked with Arca (who also produced EP2), Dev Hynes, Sampha, Paul Epworth and others for her 2014 debut album, LP1.\n\nIn 2015, twigs dropped her third extended play, M3LL155X, which was inspired by a \u201cspontaneous creative period\u201d immediately following the completion of her debut studio album. The extended play, pronounced \u201cMelissa,\u201d is named after her \u201cpersonal female energy,\u201d but Twigs assures that it is not an alter-ego.\n\nFive years after LP1, twigs returned with a sophomore album, titled MAGDALENE in 2019, after releasing a standalone single, Good To Love in 2016, and being featured on a track with A$AP Rocky, named Fukk Sleep in 2018."
