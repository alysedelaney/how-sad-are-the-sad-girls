      "plain": "Orla Gartland is a self-proclaimed alternative pop artist, born in Dublin on February 3, 1995. She is best known for her songwriting credits on the BTS song \u201c134340\u201d, her break-out single \u201cI Go Crazy.\u201d, and her feature on the Heartstopper soundtrack with \u201cWhy Am I Like This?\u201d\n\nOrla started in humble beginnings, gaining popularity for posting cover songs on YouTube. In her childhood, Orla quickly picked up and began playing the fiddle at the age of 5, and then moving to guitar at 12. When she was 13 she uploaded her first video, a cover of Beyonce\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d. Orla continued to upload to Youtube and self-released an album featuring several covers, along with some original work in 2011.\n\nHer debut EP Roots was released in 2013, around the time she moved from Dublin to London. This was followed by another EP two years later, titled Lonely People.\n\n2016 single \u201cShapeshifting\u201d was Orla\u2019s first collaboration, working with American synth-pop duo Great Good Fine OK. The next release from Orla didn\u2019t come for another 2 years. Stand-alone single \u201cI Go Crazy\u201d announced Orla\u2019s solo comeback, and with great intensity, as the track gained one million streams in the space of 6 months. Using this momentum, another stand-alone single was dropped, \u201cBetween My Teeth.\u201d\n\n2019 saw the release of an EP, four years since Orla\u2019s last. Why Am I Like This is comprised of 4 tracks, one for each year since 2015.\n\nIn 2020, Orla released her newest EP Freckle Season comprised of five tracks, three of which were released as singles before the full EP was released."
