      "plain": "Maria-Cecilia Simone Kelly (b. May 7, 1997), better known by her stage name Rico Nasty, is a rapper who came straight out of Maryland, USA. Rico was born in D.C. and spent a few of her childhood years in New York and Virginia, but she\u2019s lived most of her life in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.\n\nRico Nasty began to blow up in mid 2016 off the hype of \u201cIggady (Remix)\u201d, \u201ciCarly\u201d, and \u201cHey Arnold\u201d. Her catchy melodic style later caught the attention of Lil Yachty who remixed Hey Arnold and brought her further attention, getting her closer to her goal of being a XXL Freshman."
