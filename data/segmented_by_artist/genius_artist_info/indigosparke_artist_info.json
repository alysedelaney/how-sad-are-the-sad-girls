      "plain": "Indigo Sparke is an Australian indie singer-songwriter. She is best known for her soaring melodies and classic acoustic tone. Her social media presence portrays a unique and thoughtful queer feminist perspective, which is further reflected by her earthy yet spectral composition and lyrical style. She has also been known to tour with her ex-partner, Adrianne Lenker, lead singer of Big Thief."
