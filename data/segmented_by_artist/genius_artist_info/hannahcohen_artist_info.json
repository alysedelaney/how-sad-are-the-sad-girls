      "plain": "Hannah Cohen has arrived home. From the title of her new album to the depth and beauty of the music, the Woodstock, NY-based singer-songwriter\u2019s third album, \u201cWelcome Home,\u201d displays a confidence and comfort with the many creative tools at her disposal.\n\nCohen\u2019s remarkably evocative voice is surrounded by dreamy, swooning incantations, from the rippling \u2018This Is Your Life\u2019 and the slow-burning, forthright statement of \u2018All I Want,\u2019 to the soul swagger of \u2018Get in Line\u2019 and dramatic vocal leaps of \u2018Wasting My Time.\u2019 Produced by Sam Evian, the artist began developing the material that became \u201cWelcome Home\u201d in 2017. Taking her time with the songs, she wrapped herself in the fulfilling quiet of a new home, and a new creative partnership that supported finding a clarity in her writing and vocals. Many of the songs were written on an old, nylon-string guitar painted with Hawaiian scenes of beaches and palm trees (which can be heard on \u2018This Is Your Life\u2019), that, no matter the final arrangement, gives the songs a lighter touch, a warming glow that suffuses the whole album. Listeners may find echoes of folk and R&B, radiating with vocal-powered pop production, electronic accents, and bursts of pulsing guitar/bass/drums energy. Irresistible echoes of soul enchanters such as Carrie Cleveland (an early touchstone for Cohen and Evian), Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers and their friend and sometime collaborator Nick Hakim blend with the reflective singer/writer forebears such as Carole King."
